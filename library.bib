	Abstract = {The coalescence of massive black hole binaries is one of the main sources of low-frequency gravitational radiation that can be detected by LISA. When two galaxies containing massive black holes merge, a binary forms at the center of the new galaxy. We discuss the evolution of the binary after its separation decreases below one parsec. Whether or not stellar dynamical processes can drive the black holes to coalesce depends on the supply of stars that scatter against the binary. We discuss various mechanisms by which this supply can be replenished after the loss cone has been depleted.},

@article{Gaskell:2013a,
	Abstract = {Velocity-resolved reverberation mapping suggests that the broad-line regions (BLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can have significant net inflow. We use the STOKES radiative transfer code to show that electron and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and torus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization lines and the ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the geometry of the scattering region. If correct, then this model resolves the long-standing conflict between the absence of outflow implied by velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow if the blueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the inflow is sufficient to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the outer accretion disk and that similar magnetohydrodynamic processes are operating. In the scattering model, the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so high-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts, as is observed. Scattering can lead to systematically too high black hole mass estimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities between narrow-line region (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have a similar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad absorption line QSOs if they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from the BLR and torus could be more important in the UV than electron scattering for predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance of Rayleigh scattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line profiles at different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region.},

	Abstract = {Orbital motion in triaxial nuclei with central point masses, representing supermassive black holes, is investigated. The stellar density is assumed to follow a power law rho~r-gamma, with gamma=1 or gamma=2. At low energies the motion is essentially regular; the major families of orbits are tubes and pyramids. Pyramid orbits are similar to box orbits but have their major elongation parallel to the short axis of the figure. A number of regular orbit families associated with resonances also exist, most prominently the banana orbits, which are also elongated parallel to the short axis. At a radius where the enclosed stellar mass is a few times the black hole mass, the pyramid orbits become stochastic. The energy of transition to this ``zone of chaos'' is computed as a function of gamma and of the shape of the stellar figure; it occurs at lower energies in more elongated potentials. Our results suggest that supermassive black holes may place tight constraints on departures from axisymmetry in galactic nuclei by both limiting the allowed shapes of regular orbits and inducing chaos.},

In this picture, the light we see originates in a vast amalgam of emitters but is dominated by those emitters best able to reprocess the incident continuum into a particular emission line. We test this ``locally optimally emitting clouds'' (LOC) model against the extensive spectroscopic database of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548. The time-averaged, integrated-light UV broad emission line spectrum from the 1993 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) monitoring campaign is reproduced via the optimization of three global geometric parameters: the outer radius, the index controlling the radial cloud covering fraction of the continuum source, and the integrated cloud covering fraction. We make an ad hoc selection from the range of successful models, and for a simple spherical BLR geometry we simulate the emission-line light curves for the 1989 IUE and 1993 HST campaigns, using the respective observed UV continuum light curves as drivers. We find good agreement between the predicted and observed light curves and lags-a demonstration of the LOC picture's viability as a means to understanding the BLR environment. Finally, we discuss the next step in developing the LOC picture, which involves the marriage of echo-mapping techniques with spectral simulation grids such as those presented here, using the constraints provided by a high-quality, temporally well-sampled spectroscopic data set.},

To this end, we adopt and adapt the techniques developed by Strubbe \& Quataert to study the optical emission lines produced when a main-sequence star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (BH). WDs are tidally disrupted outside of the event horizon of a <105 M sun BH, which makes these tidal disruption events good signposts of IMBHs. We focus on the optical and UV emission lines produced when the accretion flare photoionizes the stream of debris that remains unbound during the disruption. We find that the spectrum is dominated by lines due to ions of C and O, the strongest of which are C IV λ1549 at early times and {$[$}O III{$]$} λ5007 at later times. Furthermore, we model the profile of the emission lines in the {$[$}O III{$]$} λλ4959, 5007 doublet and find that it is highly asymmetric with velocity widths of up to \~{}2500 km s-1, depending on the properties of the WD-IMBH system and the orientation of the observer. Finally, we compare the models with observations of X-ray flares and optical emission lines in the cores of globular clusters and propose how future observations can test if these features are due to a WD that has been tidally disrupted by an IMBH.},

	N2 = {The properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their afterglows are used to investigate the location of star formation activity through the history of the Universe. This approach is motivated by the following: (i) GRBs are thought to be associated with the deaths of massive stars and so the GRB rate ought to follow the formation rate of massive stars; (ii) GRBs are the last phase of the evolution of these stars, which do not live long enough to travel far from their place of birth, and so GRBs are located where the stars formed; and (iii) GRB afterglows occur over both X-ray and optical wavelengths, and so the differential effects of dust extinction between the two wavebands can reveal whether or not large amounts of dust are present in galaxies hosting GRBs. Recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of stars in the Universe formed in galaxies that are bright at rest-frame submillimetre (submm) and infrared wavelengths rather than at ultraviolet wavelengths; we estimate about three quarters of the star formation in the Universe occurred in the submm-bright mode. High-redshift submm-selected galaxies are thought to have properties similar to local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) such as Arp 220, based on the concordance between their luminosities and spectral energy distributions. If this is the case, then GRBs in submm-bright galaxies should have their optical afterglows extinguished by internal dust absorption, but only very few should have their 2-10keV X-ray afterglows obscured. The value that we quote of three quarters is marginally consistent with observations of GRBs: 60+/-15 per cent of GRBs have no detected optical afterglow, whereas almost all have an X-ray afterglow. A more definitive statement could be made with observations of soft X-ray afterglows (0.5-2keV), in which extinction should be severe for GRBs located in submm-bright galaxies with gas densities similar to those in local ULIGs. If the X-ray afterglows disappear at soft X-ray wavelengths in a large number of GRBs, then this would provide strong evidence that much of the star-formation in the Universe is heavily obscured. Far-infrared and submm follow up studies of the hosts of GRB would reveal this population. We expect about 20 per cent of GRB hosts to be detectable using the SCUBA camera at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) after several hours of integration.},

Particular attention is paid to the identification of the main physical properties or mechanisms responsible for this behaviour. Indeed, understanding the mechanical structure of an object provides valuable information about its internal structure, composition and heat content as well as its formation history. Although the general description of these properties is reasonably well mastered, disagreement between theory and observation in certain cases points to some missing physics in our present modelling of at least some of these objects. The mass-radius relationship in the overlaping domain between giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs is shown to represent a powerful diagnostic to distinguish between these two different populations and shows once again that the present IAU distinction between these two populations at a given mass has no valid foundation.},

Both disruptive and nondisruptive encounters are considered. We identify and discuss relativistic effects important for the problem: relativistic shift of the pericenter distance, time delay, relativistic precession, and the tensorial structure of the tidal forces. In the nondisruptive case, stripping of matter takes place. In the surface layers of the surviving core, complicated hydrodynamical phenomena are revealed. In both disruptive and nondispruptive encounters, material flows out in the form of two thin, S-shaped, supersonic jets. Our results provide realistic initial conditions for the subsequent investigation of the dynamics of the debris in the field of the black hole. We evaluate the critical conditions for complete disruption of the white dwarf, and compare our results with the corresponding results for nonrelativistic encounters.},

The principal feature of the method is the use of statistical techniques to recover analytical expressions for the physical variables from a known distribution of fluid elements. The equations of motion take the form of Newtonian equations for particles. Starting with a nonaxisymmetric distribution of approximately 80 particles in three dimensions, the method is found to reproduce the structure of uniformly rotating and magnetic polytropes to within a few percent. The method may be easily extended to deal with more complicated physical models.},

The transfer code SEDONA has been developed to calculate the light curves, spectra, and polarization of aspherical supernova models. From the onset of free expansion in the supernova ejecta, SEDONA solves the radiative transfer problem self-consistently, including a detailed treatment of gamma-ray transfer from radioactive decay and with a radiative equilibrium solution of the temperature structure. Line fluorescence processes can also be treated directly. No free parameters need be adjusted in the radiative transfer calculation, providing a direct link between multidimensional hydrodynamic explosion models and observations. We describe the computational techniques applied in SEDONA and verify the code by comparison to existing calculations. We find that convergence of the Monte Carlo method is rapid and stable even for complicated multidimensional configurations. We also investigate the accuracy of a few commonly applied approximations in supernova transfer, namely, the stationarity approximation and the two-level atom expansion opacity formalism.},

There are good reasons to believe that perhaps most type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarfs that have approached the Chandrasekhar mass, Mchan ≈1.39Msolar, and are disrupted by thermonuclear fusion of carbon and oxygen. However, the mechanism whereby such accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs explode continues to be uncertain. Recent progress in modeling type Ia supernovae as well as several of the still open questions are addressed in this review. Although the main emphasis is on studies of the explosion mechanism itself and on the related physical processes, including the physics of turbulent nuclear combustion in degenerate stars, we also discuss observational constraints.},

It is noted that disk modeling is in some sense more an art than a science, and since a steady disk can be constructed for almost any combination of viscosity and radiation processes, the possibilities are almost endless. Conversely, it is likely that more can be learned about the properties of accretion disks in astrophysics by observation and subsequent modeling than by pure theorizing.},

	N2 = {The goal of this work is to show how large cosmological N-body simulations are computed, how structures within such simulations can be identified with observed galaxies, and how the weak gravitational lensing effect of large scale structure introduces changes in the observed brightness of high redshift sources. We describe PKDGRAV, a fully parallel N-body code that can both spatially adapt to large ranges in particle densities, and temporally adapt to large ranges in dynamical timescales. Care has been taken to insure that the code runs efficiently on a variety of parallel architectures. This has led us to using a non-standard data structure for efficiently calculating the gravitational forces, a variant on the k-D tree, and a new method for treating periodic boundary conditions. A major problem with the interpretation of cosmological N-body simulations has always been identifying the positions and velocities of the ``galaxies'' in simulations. Observational constraints almost always concern the position and velocities of galaxies, not of the dark matter background. We present our grouping algorithm, SKID, which can identify galaxy halos independent of the environment in which the halo is found, a property that is very important given the large dynamic range in background densities present in cosmological simulations. PKDGRAV has been used to perform many very high resolution cosmological N-body simulations. We give an overview of some of the scientific program that has been enabled by this code. We present the magnification distributions due to weak lensing through all the intervening large scale structure from an observer to a source at z = 1. We show that the distribution is a highly skewed one with a shifted mode implying a slight demagnification bias and an extended tail toward high magnification. We investigate the implications of these results on the observations of high redshift type-Ia supernovae and show how these can be used to provide a new cosmological test.},

The effective tidal radius for parabolic orbits is derived. For deeper plunging, the stellar core undergoes strong compression; the affine star model with a semidegenerate, semirelativistic equation of state is used to describe the evolution of thermodynamical parameters such as density, temperature, and electron degeneracy. The dynamics are coupled with a nuclear network to explore explosive nucleosynthesis during strong compression phase. Nuclear processes can be triggered only in helium stars, which build up heavy isotopes with alpha structure. In the most favorable cases the nuclear energy release is comparable to that of type II supernovae.},

Symmetry considerations, the use of a well adapted moving grid and a well adapted moving frame along with integration of the partial differential equations by means of pseudo-spectral methods result in a very powerful and accurate tool. The hydrodynamical equations are written in a moving frame which mimics the bulk of the movement of the fluid, resulting in very small relative velocities and a well suited spatial resolution throughout the calculations. Therefore, the numerical calculations are considerably simplified, smoothing in particular the Courant condition. Typical runs are performed within a few hours on a workstation with the high accuracy linked to the spectral methods. Predictions of the so-called affine model are tested against this full numerical simulation.},

	N2 = {A star can be tidally disrupted around a massive black hole. It is known that the debris forms a precessing stream, which may collide with itself. The stream collision is a key process in determining the subsequent evolution of the stellar debris: if the orbital energy is efficiently dissipated, the debris will eventually form a circular disk (or torus). In this paper, we have numerically studied such a stream collision resulting from the encounter between a 10\^{}6 M{\_}solar black hole and a 1 M{\_}solar normal star with a pericenter radius of 100 R{\_}solar. A simple treatment for radiative cooling has been adopted for both optically thick and optically thin regions. We have found that approximately 10{\%} to 15{\%} of the initial kinetic energy of the streams is converted into thermal energy during the collision. The spread in angular momentum of the incoming stream is increased by a factor of 2 to 3, and such an increase, together with the decrease in kinetic energy, significantly helps the circularization process. The initial luminosity burst produced by the collision may reach as high as 10\^{}41 ergs s\^{}-1 in 10\^{}4 s, after which the luminosity increases again (but slowly this time) to a steady value of a few 10\^{}40 ergs s\^{}-1 in a few times 10\^{}5 s. The radiation from the system is expected to be close to Planckian, with an effective temperature of \~{}10\^{}5 K.},

The formation of a power-law cusp in the stellar density distribution of a globular cluster is analyzed, the rate at which stars in the cusp are swallowed or disrupted by the black hole is estimated, and probable observable manifestations of these processes are considered. It is argued that most stars on orbits with radii less than or approximately equal to some defined 'critical radius' will diffuse into low-angular-momentum 'loss-cone' orbits on a timescale comparable to the stellar relaxation time in the cluster core and will ultimately be swallowed by the black hole. The results are applied to Hills' (1975) model of a galactic nucleus containing a black hole of at least 10 million solar masses.},

	N2 = {Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The MHD nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical MHD codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article. The authors conclude with a summary of what is now known of disk turbulence and mention some knotty outstanding questions (e.g., what is the physics behind nonlinear field saturation?) for which we may soon begin to develop answers.},

The increase in efficiency is due to the use of a grid both for the calculation of gravitational forces and for the determination of nearest neighbours. Sufficient accuracy is achieved on coarse grids by the use of a short range correction for the gravitational force. Storage problems are thereby eliminated. Other improvements include the use of interpolation kernels based on B-splines, the use of particles with different masses and the use of a simple efficient artificial viscosity. A wide variety of tests confirm the overall accuracy.},

Also given is the rate at which bound mass returns to pericenter after orbiting the hole once. The processes that determine the time scale to circularize the debris orbits and allow an accretion torus to form are discussed. This time scale and the time scales for radiative cooling and accretion inflow determine the onset and duration of the subsequent flare in the AGN luminosity.},

Using a relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, we investigate the fate of main-sequence and helium stars in plunge orbits passing near Schwarzschild or Kerr black holes of mass \~{}105-106 Msolar. We show that quadrupole gravitational waves emitted during the tidal disruption process are described reasonably well by a point-particle approximation even in the strong-encounter case. An additional hydrodynamic calculation based on the Godunov method indicates that shocks develop for sufficiently high tidal compressions. The shock heating results in an X-ray flare, which for solar-type stars disrupted by \~{}106 Msolar black holes is in the keV range associated with the gravitational wave signal. The hardness and duration of the X-ray flare may serve as a diagnostic of the mass of the central black hole.},

It is shown that new specific relativistic effects occur. In particular, tidal compression acting on the direction orthogonal to the orbital plane of the star may induce formation of many successive strong squeezings of the star when the periastron of its orbit is sufficiently close to the horizon of the black hole.

	N2 = {There is strong evidence for some kind of massive dark object in the centres of many galaxy bulges. The detection of flares from tidally disrupted stars could confirm that these objects are black holes (BHs). Here we present calculations of the stellar disruption rates in detailed dynamical models of real galaxies, taking into account the refilling of the loss cone of stars on disruptable orbits by two-body relaxation and tidal forces in non-spherical galaxies. The highest disruption rates (one star per 104yr) occur in faint (L<\~{}1010Lsolar) galaxies, which have steep central density cusps. More luminous galaxies are less dense and have much longer relaxation times and more massive BHs. Dwarf stars in such galaxies are swallowed whole by the BH and hence do not emit flares; giant stars could produce flares as often as every 105yr, although the rate depends sensitively on the shape of the stellar distribution function. We discuss the possibility of detecting disruption flares in current supernova searches. The total mass of stars consumed over the lifetime of the galaxy is of the order of 106Msolar, independent of galaxy luminosity; thus, disrupted stars may contribute significantly to the present BH mass in galaxies fainter than \~{}109Lsolar.},

	N2 = {We model the 1990 giant X-ray flare of the quiescent galaxy NGC 5905 as the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. From the observed rapid decline of the luminosity, over a timescale of a few years, we argue that the flare was powered by the fallback of debris rather than subsequent accretion via a thin disk. The fallback model allows constraints to be set on the black hole mass and the mass of debris. The latter must be very much less than a solar mass to explain the very low luminosity of the flare. The observations can be explained either as the partial stripping of the outer layers of a low-mass main-sequence star or as the disruption of a brown dwarf or a giant planet. We find that the X-ray emission in the flare must have originated within a small patch rather than over the entire torus of circularized material surrounding the black hole. We suggest that the patch corresponds to the ``bright spot'' where the stream of returning debris impacts the torus. Interestingly, although the peak luminosity of the flare was highly sub-Eddington, the peak flux from the bright spot was close to the Eddington limit. We speculate on the implications of this result for observations of other flare events.},

Explicit results are given of numerical integration of the dynamic equations of motion of the affine star model in various cases that have not been examined in detail before, concentrating on the regime prior to the release of dynamically significant nuclear energy, where the model can be expected to be most reliable. In addition to studies aimed at improved realism in the treatment of medium-mass and higher mass stars on the basis of the neutral affine analog of Eddington's standard model (using a simple treatment of the separate contributions of gas and radiation pressure), the work also includes studies of the incompressible limit, aimed at completing the classical work on this subject, and also studies the effect of (artificially high) viscous dissipation, aimed at comparison with the first crude hydrodynamic investigations, in which artificial dissipative effects are important.},

The canonical equations of internal motion are noted to be the same as those obtainable through an application of the tensor virial theorem to the first terms in a Taylor expansion about the center of a corresponding Newtonian hydrodynamic model. An extension to the general compressible case of the classical Dedekind theorem for incompressible fluid models arises from the discrete symmetry of the Lagrangian L(I) under the operation of replacing the deformation matrix by its transpose. After a discussion of the mechanical properties arising from these symmetries, it is shown that any equilibrium state of a general, compressible affine star model is conformally related to one of the equilibrium states of the corresponding incompressible fluid model.},

Upon rapid decompression, nuclear-density medium condenses into neutron-rich nuclei, most of them radioactive. Radioactivity provides a long-term heat source for the expanding envelope. A brief transient has a peak luminosity in the supernova range, and the bulk of radiation in the UV-optical domain. We present a very crude model of the phenomenon, and simple analytical formulae that can be used to estimate the parameters of a transient as a function of poorly known input parameters. The mergers may be detected with high-redshift supernova searches as rapid transients, many of them far away from the parent galaxies. It is possible that the mysterious optical transients detected by Schmidt et al. are related to neutron star mergers, since they typically have no visible host galaxy.},

	N2 = {Models of thick accretion disks surrounding black holes are developed which have a consistent time-averaged stationary behavior, and implications of these models for disk luminosity are examined. The approach employed uses a pseudo-Newtonian potential which reproduces many of the important features of the Schwarzschild solution and is not explicitly dependent on the assumed form of the viscosity law, with a global energy conservation requirement and a critical local radiated flux. The resulting disks have cusps at their inner edges, which lie between the marginally bound and marginally stable orbits, and depend on the specified angular momentum distribution. Accretion rates can become very large, and the total luminosity can exceed the nominal Eddington luminosity due to geometrical effects, possibly leading to the formation of well-collimated beams. In addition, the thick models derived can be matched onto relatively thin disks beyond a certain transition radius.},

However, a simple Euler transformation gives series that do converge all the way to the outer radius. These Euler-transformed series converge significantly faster than the series in the contained mass derived by Roxburgh \& Stockman, which are limited to finite radii whenever n>5 by a complex conjugate pair of singularities.

For a polytrope with index n<=1.9 the series appear to converge everywhere inside the star. For n>1.9 the series converges in the inner radii, but then diverges. To improve the convergence radii of the series we used a combination of two accelerating techniques, Euler-Abel transformation and Pad{\'e}approximation. These transformed series converge everywhere for n<=5.

	N2 = {We examine the relation between presupernova stellar structure and the distribution of ejecta in core-collapse supernovae of Types Ib, Ic, and II, under the approximations of adiabatic, spherically symmetric flow. We develop a simple yet accurate analytical formula for the velocity of the initial forward shock that traverses the stellar envelope. For material that does not later experience a strong reverse shock, the entropy deposited by this forward shock persists into the final, freely expanding state. We demonstrate that the final density distribution can be approximated with simple models for the final pressure distribution, in a way that matches the results of simulations. Our results indicate that the distribution of density and radiation pressure in a star's ejecta depends on whether the outer envelope is radiative or convective, and if convective, on the composition structure of the star. Our models are most accurate for the high-velocity ejecta cast away from the periphery of a star. For stellar structures that limit to a common form in this region, the resulting ejecta limit to a common distribution at high velocities because the blast wave forgets its history as it approaches the stellar surface. We present formulae for the final density distribution of this material as a function of mass, for both radiative and efficiently convective envelopes. These formulae limit to the well-known planar, self-similar solutions for mass shells approaching the stellar surface. However, the assumption of adiabatic flow breaks down for shells of low optical depth, so this planar limit need not be attained. The event of shock emergence, which limits adiabatic flow, also produces a soft X-ray burst of radiation. Formulae are given for the observable properties of this burst and their dependence on the parameters of the explosion. Motivated by the relativistic expansion recently inferred by Kulkarni et al. for the synchrotron shell around SN 1998bw, we estimate the criterion for relativistic mass ejection and the rest mass of relativistic ejecta. We base our models for the entire ejecta distribution on the high-velocity solution, on our shock-velocity formula, and on realistic radiation pressure distributions. We also present simpler, but less flexible, analytical approximations for ejecta distributions. We survey the ejecta of the polytropic hydrogen envelopes of red supergiants. Our models will be useful for studies of the light curves and circumstellar or interstellar interactions of core-collapse supernovae, and of the birth of pulsar nebulae in their ejecta.},

Such events are usually only detected at least a few days after the star has exploded. Observations of the supernova SNLS-04D2dc with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer space telescope reveal a radiative precursor from the supernova shock before the shock reached the surface of the star and show the initial expansion of the star at the beginning of the explosion. Theoretical models of the ultraviolet light curve confirm that the progenitor was a red supergiant, as expected for this type of supernova. These observations provide a way to probe the physics of core-collapse supernovae and the internal structures of their progenitor stars.},

Evolved stars have mean molecular weight gradients, which affect their entropy profiles and therefore affect how they react during a collision. The structure of stellar collision products of polytrope parent stars is significantly different from that of collision products of realistic parent models. These differences strongly affect the future evolution of the collision products, particularly products of collisions between unequal mass stars which have undergone significant chemical evolution. The use of polytropes as parent star models is likely to result in qualitatively mistaken results for the structure of the collision product.},

We calculate disruption rates for the bound, and the unbound, stars. The rates are smaller than, but comparable to, rates for non-recoiling black holes. A key observational consequence is the existence of powerful off-nuclear and intergalactic X-ray flares. We also discuss other observable signatures associated with the bound stars, including episodic X-ray emission from accretion due to stellar mass loss; intergalactic supernovae; and feedback trails.},

Here we report the first systematic study of gravitational recoil of equal-mass binaries with equal, but counteraligned, spins parallel to the orbital plane. Such an orientation of the spins is expected to maximize the recoil. We find that recoil velocity (which is perpendicular to the orbital plane) varies sinusoidally with the angle that the initial spin directions make with the initial linear momenta of each hole and scales up to a maximum of ˜4000kms-1 for maximally rotating holes. Our results show that the amplitude of the recoil velocity can depend sensitively on spin orientations of the black holes prior to merger.},

	N2 = {The activity of active galaxies may be triggered by the merging of galaxies, and present-day galaxies are probably the product of successive minor mergers. The frequent galactic mergers at high redshift imply that active galaxies harbour supermassive unequal-mass binary black holes at their centre at least once during their lifetime. The secondary black hole interacts and becomes coplanar with the accretion disc around the primary, inwardly spiraling toward their mass centre owing to the loss of orbital angular momentum to the disc mass outside the orbit of the secondary and/or to gravitational radiation. The binary black holes finally merge and form a more massive (post-merged) black hole at the centre. In this paper it is shown that the recently-discovered double-lobed FR II radio galaxies are the remnants of such supermassive binary black holes. The inwardly spiraling secondary black hole opens a gap in the accretion disc that increases with time when the loss of the orbital angular momentum via gravitational radiation becomes dominant. When the supermassive black holes merge, the inner accretion disc disappears and the gap becomes a big hole of several hundreds of Schwarzschild radii in the vicinity of the post-merged supermassive black hole, leading to an interruption of jet formation. When the outer accretion disc slowly refills the big hole on a viscous time-scale, jet formation restarts and the interaction of the recurrent jets and the inter-galactic medium forms a secondary pair of lobes. The model is applied to a particular double-lobed radio source - B1834+620 - which has an interruption time-scale \~{}1 Myr. It is shown that the orbit of the secondary in B1834+620 is elliptical with a typical eccentricity e\~{}= 0.68 and that the ratio q of the mass of the secondary to that of the primary is 0.01 <\~{}q<\~{} 0.4. The accretion disc is a standard α-disc with 0.01 <\~{}α<\~{} 0.04 and the ratio of disc half height H to radius r is δ\~{}= 0.01. The model predicts that double-lobed radio structures form only in FR II or borderline FR I/FR II radio galaxies and that the detection rate of double-lobed radio sources among FR II radio sources is about one per cent.},

	N2 = {We demonstrate the existence of an enhanced rate of angular momentum relaxation in nearly Keplerian star clusters, such as those found in the centers of galactic nuclei containing massive black holes. The enhanced relaxation arises because the radial and azimuthal orbital frequencies in a Keplerian potential are equal, and hence may be termed resonant relaxation. We explore the dynamics of resonant relaxation using both numerical simulations and order-of-magnitude analytic calculations. We find that the resonant angular momentum relaxation time is shorter than the non-resonant relaxation time by of order M{\_}star/M, where M{\_}star is the mass in stars and M is the mass of the central object. Resonance does not enhance the energy relaxation rate. We examine the effect of resonant relaxation on the rate of tidal disruption of stars by the central mass; we find that the flux of stars into the loss cone is enhanced when the loss cone is empty, but that the disruption rate averaged over the entire cluster is not strongly affected. We show that relativistic precession can disable resonant relaxation near the main-sequence loss cone for black hole masses comparable to those in galactic nuclei. Resonant dynamical friction leads to growth or decay of the eccentricity of the orbit of a massive body, depending on whether the distribution function of the stars is predominantly radial or tangential. The accelerated relaxation implies that there are regions in nuclear star clusters that are relaxed in angular momentum but not in energy; unfortunately, these regions are not well-resolved in most nearby galaxies by the Hubble Space Telescope.},

Fifty of these mass measurements are considered reliable, while the others remain somewhat uncertain at this time. An additional eight stellar systems, including one stellar cluster and three globular clusters, are listed as hosting potential intermediate mass black holes < 10\^{}6 M{\_}solar. With this larger data set, the demographics within the M{\_}bh-sigma{\_}0 diagram are briefly explored. Many barred galaxies are shown to be offset from the M{\_}bh-sigma{\_}0 relation defined by the non-barred galaxies, in the sense that their velocity dispersions are too high. Furthermore, including 88 AGN with black hole mass estimates from reverberation mapping studies, we speculate that barred AGN may follow this same general trend. We also show that some AGN with sigma{\_}0 < 100 km/s tend to reside up to 0.6 dex above the "barless" M{\_}bh-sigma{\_}0 relation. Finally, it is shown that ``core galaxies''appear not to define an additional subdivision of the M{\_}bh-sigma{\_}0 diagram, although improved methods for measuring sigma{\_}0-values will be valuable.},

The work reported here extends our previous investigation in general relativistic hydrodynamics (Banyuls et al. 1997) where magnetic fields were not considered. The GRMHD equations are written in conservative form to exploit their hyperbolic character in the solution procedure. All theoretical ingredients necessary to build up high-resolution shock-capturing schemes based on the solution of local Riemann problems (i.e., Godunov-type schemes) are described. In particular, we use a renormalized set of regular eigenvectors of the flux Jacobians of the relativistic MHD equations. In addition, the paper describes a procedure based on the equivalence principle of general relativity that allows the use of Riemann solvers designed for special relativistic MHD in GRMHD. Our formulation and numerical methodology are assessed by performing various test simulations recently considered by different authors. These include magnetized shock tubes, spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, equatorial accretion onto a Kerr black hole, and magnetized thick disks accreting onto a black hole and subject to the magnetorotational instability.},

The FLASH code was developed to study the problems of nuclear flashes on the surfaces of neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as in the interior of white dwarfs. We expect, however, that the FLASH code will be useful for solving a wide variety of other problems. This first version of the code has been subjected to a large variety of test cases and is currently being used for production simulations of X-ray bursts, Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities, and thermonuclear flame fronts. The FLASH code is portable and already runs on a wide variety of massively parallel machines, including some of the largest machines now extant.},

	N2 = {Of the 14 transiting extrasolar planetary systems for which radii have been measured, at least three appear to be considerably larger than theoretical estimates suggest. It has been proposed by Bodenheimer, Lin \& Mardling that undetected companions acting to excite the orbital eccentricity are responsible for these oversized planets, as they find new equilibrium radii in response to being tidally heated. In the case of HD 209458, this hypothesis has been rejected by some authors because there is no sign of such a companion at the 5 ms-1 level, and because it is difficult to say conclusively that the eccentricity is non-zero. Transit timing analysis as well as a direct transit search has further constrained the existence of very short period companions, especially in resonant orbits. Whether or not a companion is responsible for the large radius of HD 209458b, almost certainly some short-period systems have companions which force their eccentricities to non-zero values. This paper is dedicated to quantifying this effect. The eccentricity of a short-period planet will only be excited as long as its (non-resonant) companion's eccentricity is non-zero. Here, we show that the latter decays on a time-scale which depends on the structure of the interior planet, a time-scale which is often shorter than the lifetime of the system. This includes Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of some stars. We determine which configurations are capable of sustaining significant eccentricity for at least the age of the system, and show that these include systems with companion masses as low as a fraction of an Earth mass. The orbital parameters of such companions are consistent with recent calculations which show that the migration process can induce the formation of low-mass planets external to the orbits of hot Jupiters. Systems with inflated planets are therefore good targets in the search for terrestrial planets.},

The choice of a biquintic Hermite polynomial as the interpolating function results in accurately reproducing the underlying Helmholtz free energy data in the table, and yields derivatives of the pressure, specific entropy, and specific internal energy which are smooth and continuous. The execution speed-evaluated across several different machine architectures, compiler options, and modes of operation-suggests that the Helmholtz equation of state routine is faster than any of the five equation of state routines surveyed by Timmes \& Arnett. When an optimal balance of accuracy, thermodynamic consistency, and speed is desirable then the tabular Helmholtz equation of state is an excellent choice, particularly for multidimensional models of stellar phenomena.},

	N2 = {The orbital separation of compact binary stars will shrink with time owing to the emission of gravitational radiation. This inspiral phase of a binary system's evolution generally will be very long compared to the system's orbital period, but the final coalescence may be dynamical and driven to a large degree by hydrodynamic effects, particularly if there is a critical separation at which the system becomes dynamically unstable toward merger. Indeed, if weakly relativistic systems (such as white dwarf-white dwarf binaries) encounter a point of dynamical instability at some critically close separation, coalescence may be entirely a classical, hydrodynamic process. Therefore, a proper investigation of this stage of binary evolution must include three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We have constructed equilibrium sequences of synchronously rotating, equal-mass binaries in circular orbit with a single parameter--the binary separation--varying along each sequence. Sequences have been constructed with various polytropic as well as realistic white dwarf and neutron star equations of state. Using a Newtonian, finite-difference hydrodynamics code, we have examined the dynamical stability of individual models along these equilibrium sequences. Our simulations indicate that no points of instability exist on the sequences we analyzed that had relatively soft equations of state (polytropic sequences with polytropic index n = 1.0 and 1.5 and two white dwarf sequences). However, we did identify dynamically unstable binary models on sequences with stiffer equations of state (n = 0.5 polytropic sequence and two neutron star sequences). We thus infer that binary systems with soft equations of state are not driven to merger by a dynamical instability. For the n = 0.5 polytropic sequence, the separation at which a dynamical instability sets in appears to be associated with the minimum energy and angular momentum configuration along the sequence. Our simulations suggest but do not conclusively demonstrate that, in the absence of relativistic effects, this same association may also hold for binary neutron star systems.},

	N2 = {The numerical modeling of binary neutron star mergers has become a subject of much interest in recent years. While a full and accurate model of this phenomenon would require the evolution of the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics along with the Einstein field equations, a qualitative study of the early stages on inspiral can be accomplished by either Newtonian or post-Newtonian models, which are more tractable. However, even purely Newtonian models present numerical challenges that must be overcome in order to have accurate models of the inspiral. In particular, the simulations must maintain conservation of both energy and momenta and otherwise exhibit good numerical behavior. A spate of recent papers have detailed the results for Newtonian and post-Newtonian models of neutron star coalescence from a variety of groups who employ very different numerical schemes. These include calculations that have been carried out in both inertial and rotating frames, as well as calculations that employ both equilibrium configurations and spherical stars as initial data. However, only a few papers have given attention to the issue of the accuracy of the models and the dependence of the results on the computational frame and the initial data. In this paper we offer a comparison of results from both rotating and nonrotating (inertial) frame calculations. We find that the rotating frame calculations offer significantly improved accuracy as compared with the inertial frame models. Furthermore, we show that inertial frame models exhibit significant and erroneous angular momentum loss during the simulations that leads to an unphysical inspiral of the two neutron stars. We also examine the dependence of the models on initial conditions by considering initial configurations that consist of spherical neutron stars as well as stars that are in equilibrium and are tidally distorted. We compare our models to those given by Rasio \& Shapiro in 1992 and 1994 and by New \& Tohline in 1997. Finally, we investigate the use of the isolated star approximation for the construction of initial data.},

	N2 = {Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.},

Flares from black holes above \~{}2x10\^{}7 M{\_}solar will generally not radiate above the Eddington limit. For a Schwarzschild black hole, the maximum bolometric luminosity of a tidal disruption is \~{}L{\_}Edd 5x10\^{}7 M{\_}solar, which is substantially below the Eddington luminosities of the most massive disrupting black holes (\~{}2x10\^{}8 M{\_}solar). Bolometric corrections to the spectra of the brightest flares are found to be large, \~{}7.5 mag. Nevertheless, the brightest flares are likely to have absolute magnitudes in excess of -19 in V and -21 in U (in the absence of reddening). Because the spectra are so blue, K-corrections may actually brighten the flares in optical bands. If such flares are as frequent as believed, they may soon be detected in low- or high-redshift supernovae searches. The He II ionizing radiation produced in the flares may dominate that which is produced by all other sources in the centers of quiescent galaxies, creating a steady state, highly ionized, fossil nebula with an extent of \~{}1 kpc that may be observable in recombination lines.},

We focus on the compression phase leading to a so-called pancake configuration of the star at the instant of greatest compression. The aim is to study the tidal compression process paying particular attention to the development of shock waves, to deduce reliable estimates of the thermodynamical quantities involved in the pancake star, and to solve a controversy about whether thermonuclear reactions can be triggered in the core of a tidally compressed star. Methods: We set up a one-dimensional hydrodynamical model adapted to the geometry of the problem. Based on the high-resolution shock-capturing Godunov-type approach, this model allows us to study the compression phase of the star in a direction orthogonal to its orbital plane. Results: We show the existence of two regimes depending on whether shock waves develop before or after the instant of maximum core compression. In both cases we confirm that high compression and heating factors in the stellar core are able to trigger a thermonuclear explosion. Moreover, we show that the shock waves carry a brief but very high peak of temperature outwards from the centre to the surface of the star. We tentatively conclude that the phenomenon could give rise to hard electromagnetic radiation, to be compared to some GRB-type flares already observed in their host galaxies. Finally, we estimate that the rate of pancake stars should be about 10-5 per galaxy per year. If generated in hard X- or γ-ray bands, several events of this kind per year should be detectable within the full observable universe.},

	N2 = {The tidal interaction of n = 1.5 polytropic stars with a massive rotating black hole is studied numerically. The general relativistic tidal potential for the Kerr metric is used to evaluate tidal forces exerted on a star. The hydrodynamic response of a star to these forces is treated in the Newtonian approximation using a three-dimensional, Eulerian, PPM hydrodynamical code. We compute the energy, Delta E, and angular momentum, Delta L, transferred into a star and the mass, Delta M, lost by the star during the interaction. The quantities Delta E, Delta L, and Delta M depend on the stellar orbit, stellar structure, and the black hole's mass and angular momentum in a complicated way. We show that the dependence can be factorized by introducing a single dimensionless parameter C hat proportional to the integral of the square of the trace of the tidal tensor along the stellar trajectory. The energy and angular momentum transfer, and the mass loss as functions of C hat are found in hydrodynamical simulations. Analytical approximations to Delta E(C hat ) and Delta M(C hat ) are constructed. The value of C hat does not depend on the stellar structure. It is a universal function on the parameters of the orbit and can tabulated once and for all. Tables of C hat are presented. The results of this paper allow one to easily determine the outcome of tidal interaction for every possible combination of the input parameters. We find that the final energy of a star or a stellar remnant (if mass is lost) and its internal angular momentum as well depend most strongly on the angle between the initial orbital angular momentum and the angular momentum of the black hole.},

By simulating the relativistically moving star and its emitted light and taking into account general relativistic effects on particle and light trajectories, our results show that the black hole's gravity alone induces apparent stellar luminosity variations on typical timescales of a few rg/c {$[$}=(5s)mbh/(106Msolar){$]$} to a few 100 rg/c {$[$}\~{}(10minutes)mbh/(106Msolar){$]$}, where rg=Gmbh/c2. We discern different cases with respect to the strength of tidal interaction and focus on two: (1) a star encountering a giant black hole traces spacetime almost as a point particle, so the apparent luminosity variations are dominated by clearly recognizable general relativistic effects, and (2) in a close encounter of a star with a black hole of similar size, the stellar debris is spread around the black hole by processes in which hydrodynamics plays an important role.

	N2 = {It has recently been shown by Rauch 38 Tremaine that the rate of angular momentum relaxation in nearly Keplerian star clusters is greatly increased by a process termed `resonant relaxation' it was also argued, via a series of scaling arguments, that tidal disruption of stars in galactic nuclei containing massive black holes could be noticeably enhanced by this process. We describe here the results of numerical simulations of resonant tidal disruption which quantitatively test the predictions made by Rauch 38 Tremaine. The simulation method is based on an N-body routine incorporating cloning of stars near the loss cone and a semirelativistic symplectic integration scheme. Normalized disruption rates for resonant and non-resonant nuclei are derived at orbital energies both above and below the critical energy, and the corresponding angular momentum distribution functions are found. The black hole mass above which resonant tidal disruption is quenched by relativistic precession is determined. We also briefly describe the discovery of chaos in the Wisdom-Holman symplectic integrator applied to highly eccentric orbits and propose a modified integration scheme that remains robust under these conditions. We find that resonant disruption rates exceed their non-resonant counterparts by an amount consistent with the predictions; in particular, we estimate the net tidal disruption rate for a fully resonant cluster to be about twice that of its non-resonant counterpart. No significant enhancement in rates is observed outside the critical radius. Relativistic quenching of the effect is found to occur for hole masses M>M{\_}Q=(8+/-3)x10\^{}7M. The numerical results combined with the observed properties of galactic nuclei indicate that for most galaxies the resonant enhancement to tidal disruption rates will be very small.},

Three proposed models remain viable at this time, but none of the three are significantly more compelling than the remaining two, and all three can satisfy the observational constraints if parameters in the models are tuned. One of the three proposed models is the direct impact model of Marsh \& Steeghs, in which the accretion stream impacts the surface of a rapidly rotating primary white dwarf directly, but at a near-glancing angle. One requirement of this model is that the accretion stream have a high enough density to advect its specific kinetic energy below the photosphere for progressively more thermalized emission downstream, a constraint that requires an accretion spot size of \~{}1.2×105 km2 or smaller. Because we had at hand a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code optimized for cataclysmic variable accretion disk simulations, it was relatively straightforward for us to adapt it to calculate the footprint of the accretion stream at the nominal radius of the primary white dwarf and thus to test this constraint of the direct impact model. We find that the mass flux at the impact spot can be approximated by a bivariate Gaussian with a standard deviation of σφ=164 km in the orbital plane and σθ=23 km in the perpendicular direction. The area of the 2 σellipse into which \~{}86{\%} of the mass flux occurs is roughly 47,400 km2, or roughly half the size estimated by Marsh \& Steeghs. We discuss the necessary parameters of a simple model of the luminosity distribution in the postimpact emission region.},

The results show that, in a little more than two orbital periods, the secondary is completely destroyed and transformed into a thick disk orbiting about the primary. Since only a very small fraction of the mass (0.0063 solar mass) escapes the system, the evolution of the binary results in the formation of a massive object. This object is composed of three parts, the initial white dwarf primary, a very hot pressure-supported spherical envelope, and a rotationally supported outer disk. The evolution of the system can be understood in terms of a simple analytical model where it is shown that the angular momentum carried by the mass during the transfer and stored in the disk determines the evolution of the system.},

Because the fate of a merged system may well depend on the exact evolution of the matter temperature (as well as mixing of the merged system), precision simulations are required to determine the true fate of these systems. Unfortunately, if we compare the results of current simulations, we find many-order of magnitude differences in quantities like mass-transfer rates in the merger process. We discuss these differences and outline an approach using verification and validation that should allow us to achieve a level of precision sufficient to determine the true fate (thermonuclear vs. collapse) of double degenerate mergers. Understanding the fate of lower-mass systems (e.g. R Coronae Borealis stars) may be key in our final testing phase.},

Even with low critical densities, AIC is still much more likely than explosion for both types of white dwarfs.

Relatively fast accretion leads to a carbon deflagration at low central density that gives rise to a Type Ia supernova. Slower accretion induces a helium detonation that could be observed as a Type Ib supernova.},

The spectra were analyzed to determine abundances of the elements represented by observed emission lines from a combination of electron temperatures based on various weak temperature-sensitive lines and interpolation between photoionization models, using the sum of (O II) and (O III) intensities relative to the H beta emission to select plausible model parameters. The NGC 300 and NGC 1365 abundances are described, noting that the abundances of the latter are fairly close to solar. One object in NGC 300 is unusual in having stronger (O II) than usually found in giant H II regions in Scd galaxies, and neon, sulphur, and argon abundances relative to oxygen are close to those of Orion and the Magellanic Clouds, while the He/H ratio appears slightly lower than in Orion.},

We analyze the SDSS M-Z relation with 10 metallicity calibrations, including theoretical and empirical methods. We show that the choice of metallicity calibration has a significant effect on the shape and y-intercept {$[$}12+log(O/H){$]$} of the M-Z relation. The absolute metallicity scale (y-intercept) varies up to Δ{$[$}log(O/H){$]$}=0.7 dex, depending on the calibration used, and the change in shape is substantial. These results indicate that it is critical to use the same metallicity calibration when comparing different luminosity-metallicity or M-Z relations. We present new metallicity conversions that allow metallicities that have been derived using different strong-line calibrations to be converted to the same base calibration. These conversions facilitate comparisons between different samples, particularly comparisons between galaxies at different redshifts for which different suites of emission lines are available. Our new conversions successfully remove the large 0.7 dex discrepancies between the metallicity calibrations, and we reach agreement in the M-Z relation to within 0.03 dex on average. We investigate the effect of AGN classification and aperture covering fraction on the M-Z relation. We find that different AGN classification methods have negligible effect on the SDSS M-Z relation. We compare the SDSS M-Z relation with nuclear and global relations from the NFGS. The turnover of the M-Z relation at M*\~{}1010 Msolar depends on the aperture covering fraction. We find that a lower redshift limit of z<0.04 is insufficient for avoiding aperture effects in fiber spectra of the highest stellar mass (M*>1010 Msolar) galaxies.},

Gas fraction varies with luminosity and surface brightness at the same rate, indicating evolution at fixed size. Dim galaxies are clearly less evolved than bright ones, having consumed only \~{} \frac {\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}} of their gas. This resolves the gas consumption paradox, since there exist many galaxies with large gas reservoirs. These gas-rich galaxies must have formed the bulk of their stellar populations in the last half of a Hubble time. The existence of such immature galaxies at z = 0 indicates that either galaxy formation is a lengthy or even ongoing process, or the onset of significant star formation can be delayed for arbitrary periods in tenuous gas disks.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA}to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

These produce strong emission line diagnostics applicable to either individual H II regions in galaxies or to the integrated emission line spectra of disk or starburst galaxies. The models assume that the expansion and internal pressure of individual H II regions is driven by the net input of mechanical energy from the central cluster, be it through winds or supernova events. This eliminates the ionization parameter as a free variable, replacing it with a parameter that depends on the ratio of the cluster mass to the pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium. These models explain why H II regions with low abundances have high excitation and demonstrate that at least part of the warm ionized medium is the result of overlapping faint, old, large, and low-pressure H II regions. We present line ratios (at both optical and IR wavelengths) that provide reliable abundance diagnostics for both single H II regions or for integrated galaxy spectra, and we find a number that can be used to estimate the mean age of the cluster stars exciting individual H II regions.},

We find that, for metallicities larger than solar, the computed abundances deviate systematically from the real ones, generally by larger amounts for more metal-rich H ii regions. We discuss the reasons for this, and present diagrams allowing the reader to better understand the various factors coming into play. We briefly discuss less classical methods to derive abundances in metal-rich H ii regions. In particular, we comment on the interest of the oxygen and carbon recombination lines. We also show that, contrary to the case of giant H ii regions, the physical conditions in bright extragalactic planetary nebulae are such that their chemical composition can be accurately derived even at high metallicities. Thus, extragalactic planetary nebulae are promising potential probes of the metallicity of the interstellar medium in the internal parts of spiral galaxies as well as in metal-rich elliptical galaxies.},

Applying these techniques to the mission design proposed for the Beyond Einstein program, we find that with its very large field of view and faint gamma-ray burst detection threshold, EXIST will detect and localize approximately two bursts per day, a large fraction of which may be at high redshift. We estimate that EXIST's maximum sensitivity will be \~{}4 times greater than that of Swift's Burst Alert Telescope. Bursts will be localized to better than 40" at threshold, with a burst position as good as a few arcseconds for strong bursts. EXIST's combination of three different detector systems will provide spectra from 3 keV to more than 10 MeV. Thus, EXIST will enable a major leap in the understanding of bursts, their evolution, environment, and utility as cosmological probes.},

The outstanding characteristic of the single-degenerate scenario is that it contains hydrogen in the binary companion of the exploding white dwarf star, which, if mixed into the ejecta of the supernova in large amounts may lead to conflicts with the observations thus ruling out the scenario. Aims: We investigate the effect of the impact of type Ia supernova ejecta on a main sequence companion star of the progenitor system. With a series of simulations we investigate how different parameters of this system affect the amount of hydrogen stripped from the companion by the impact. Methods: The stellar evolution code GARSTEC is used to set up the structure of the companion stars mimicking the effect of a binary evolution phase. The impact itself is simulated with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET2. Results: We reproduce and confirm the results of earlier grid-based hydrodynamical simulation. Parameter studies of the progenitor system are extended to include the results of recent binary evolution studies. The more compact structure of the companion star found here significantly reduces the stripped hydrogen mass. Conclusions: The low hydrogen masses resulting from a more realistic companion structure are consistent with current observational constraints. Therefore, the single-degenerate scenario remains a valid possibility for type Ia supernova progenitors. These new results are not a numerical effect, but the outcome of different initial conditions.},

The rate at which mass is transferred in the merging process is at present unknown, except that it must be less than some appropriate Eddington limit. It is found that, unless mass transfer occurs at a rate less than one-fifth of the Eddington limit for an isolated dwarf, carbon is ignited off-center, and ignition does not lead immediately to a deflagration. If carbon continues to burn quiescently until it is exhausted throughout the star, a neon-oxygen-magnesium white dwarf will be formed. If a Type I supernova is to follow from merging white dwarfs, a thick disk must be formed as an intermediate stage in the merging process, with transfer from the disk onto the central degenerate dwarf occurring at a rate sufficiently less than Eddington that a deflagration induced by carbon burning occurs. Thus, the outcome of the merging of two massive carbon-oxygen degenerate dwarfs is not trivially a Type I supernova explosion.},

The merging process is simulated as a rapid mass transfer from a less massive white dwarf to a more massive one at a rate of 1×10-5M{\_}sun;yr-1. Such a rapid accretion ignites an off-center carbon flash. The authors found that the carbon burning front propagates inward all the way through the central region and hence the CO white dwarf is completely changed into an ONeMg white dwarf in a quiescent manner. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of the system will not be a type I supernova explosion induced by the carbon deflagration but a collapse triggered by electron captures on 24Mg and 20Ne to form a single neutron star. This class of neutron star might be an origin of a single millisecond pulsar.},

The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M{\_}*. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M{\_}*and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon \~{} L\^{}0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95{\%} confidence level an MDO of mass M{\_}*\~{} 0.006M{\_}bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M{\_}*= 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M{\_}*. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f \~{}= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M{\_}*/M{\_}bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation \~{}0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M{\_}*is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M{\_}bulge.},

	N2 = {We have investigated the consequences of merging double white dwarf systems by calculating evolutionary models of accreting white dwarfs. We have considered two cases: a massive C-O white dwarf of \~{}1 M{\.o}accreting C-O mixture and a low-mass white dwarf with an initial mass of 0.4 M{\.o}accreting matter composed mostly of helium. The accretion rate of the C-O white dwarf is assumed to be 1 x 10-5 M{\.o}yr-1. After carbon burning is ignited at Mr \~{} 1.04 M{\.o}, the flame propagates inward because of heat conduction. By inserting enough grid points to resolve the structure of the flame, we have obtained almost steady burning in most phases of evolution, but we have found a new phenomenon that the strength of flame sometimes oscillates because of a thermal instability in an early phase of the evolution. In calculating evolutionary models, we have occasionally employed a steady-burning approximation, in which the propagation speed of flame is given a priori. We have considered two extreme cases for the interior abundance of the massive white dwarf: XC = 0.5 and XC = 0.2. For XC = 0.5, the flame becomes very weak at Mr \~{} 0.4 M{\.o}and the inward propagation stalls there. But a few thousand years later, the flame is reactivated because of contraction and propagates to the center. For XC = 0.2, the flame propagates smoothly and reaches the center in \~{}1000 yr. In both cases the C-O mixture has been burned into an O-Ne-Mg mixture without causing an explosive phenomenon. For helium-accreting low-mass white dwarfs, we have considered accretion rates of 1 x 10-7 and 1 x 10-6 M{\.o}yr-1. After a fraction of M{\.o}is accreted to the white dwarf, helium is ignited in the outer part and a shell flash occurs. Such a shell flash diminishes when about 10{\%} of helium in the convective shell is burned into carbon and oxygen. The next shell flash occurs at a shell interior to the previously flashed shell. After less than 30 shell flashes, the helium ignition occurs at the center and steady burning begins. Thus, the merging produces a helium star that burns helium at the center. The mechanism of the propagation of the burning shell in this case is compressional heating during interpulse phases, in contrast to the case of the carbon-burning flame where the conduction drives the inward propagation of the flame. We infer that such a low-mass double white dwarf system could be a progenitor of the AM CVn stars.},

This compression leads to shock heating. The results indicate that the star does not reach the high temperatures and densities envisaged by Carter and Luminet, and the triple-αreaction does not detonate. However, for approaches of 1 M{\_}sun; stars within 10 Schwarzschild radii of a 105 M{\_}sun; black hole, significant nonequilibrium CNO processing takes place, and the energy released by the CNO reactions is comparable to the binding energy of the stars.},

We model the evolution of such stars, and show that the more luminous end of the population may indeed appear similar to young B stars within the observational limits of the Galactic Centre region. Whether some or all of these cluster stars can be accounted for in this manner depends strongly on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) of the loss cone stars and the scattering rate. If most of the observed stars are in fact scattered from the Galactic Centre inner cusp region itself then the population of \~{}20 to current observational limits may be reproduced. However, this only works if the local relaxation time is small and relies on the cusp stars themselves being young, i.e. it is dependent on some star formation being possible in the central few parsecs. Conversely, we obtain a possible constraint on the tidal stripping rate of `normal' IMF stars if there are not to be red stars visible in the Sgr A* cluster.},

When the amplitude of a tide and the subsequent oscillations are sufficiently large, the energy deposited in a star after periastron passage and formation of a bound orbit cannot be estimated directly using the linear theory of oscillations of a spherical star, but rather numerical estimates must be used. The evolution of a star after tidal capture is discussed. The maximum ratio R of the cross-section for tidal capture to that for tidal disruption is about 3 for real systems. For the case of a stellar system with an empty capture loss cone, even in the case when the impact parameter for tidal capture only slightly exceeds the impact parameter for direct tidal disruption, tidal capture would be much more important than tidal disruption.},

The transverse structure is modified by crossing points in the stream where orbits are focused across the stream center or through the orbital plane, the velocity shear across the stream, self-gravity (in the more distant encounters), recombination, shocks, and shear viscosity. During the first several orbits it is insensitive to the ambient medium and the luminosity of the active galactic nucleus. Stream-stream collisions may have a weak effect on the orbits because of Lense-Thirring precession, mismatched geometric cross sections, and the kinematics of collisions.},

	N2 = {We present new diffraction-limited images of the Galactic center, obtained with the W. M. Keck I 10 m telescope. Within 0.4" of the Galaxy's central dark mass, 17 proper-motion stars, with K magnitudes ranging from 14.0 to 16.8, are identified, and 10 of these are new detections (six were also independently discovered by others). In this sample, three newly identified (S0-16, S0-19, and S0-20) and four previously known (S0-1, S0-2, S0-4, and S0-5) sources have measured proper motions that reveal orbital solutions. Orbits are derived simultaneously so that they jointly constrain the central dark object's properties: its mass, its position, and, for the first time using orbits, its motion on the plane of the sky. This analysis pinpoints the Galaxy's central dark mass to within 1.3 mas (10 AU) and limits its proper motion to 1.5+/-0.5 mas yr-1 (or equivalently 60+/-20 km s-1) with respect to the central stellar cluster. This localization of the central dark mass is consistent with our derivation of the position of the radio source Sgr A* in the infrared reference frame (+/-10 mas) but with an uncertainty that is a factor of 8 times smaller, which greatly facilitates searches for near-infrared counterparts to the central black hole. Consequently, one previous claim for such a counterpart can now be ascribed to a close stellar passage in 1996. Furthermore, we can place a conservative upper limit of 15.5 mag on any steady state counterpart emission. The estimated central dark mass from orbital motions is 3.7(+/-0.2)×106{$[$}R0/(8kpc){$]$}3Msolar this is a more direct measure of mass than those obtained from velocity dispersion measurements, which are as much as a factor of 2 smaller. The Galactic center's distance, which adds an additional 19{\%} uncertainty in the estimated mass, is now the limiting source of uncertainty in the absolute mass. For stars in this sample, the closest approach is achieved by S0-16, which came within a mere 45 AU (=0.0002pc=600Rs) at a velocity of 12,000 km s-1. This increases the inferred dark mass density by 4 orders of magnitude compared to earlier analyses based on velocity and acceleration vectors, making the Milky Way the strongest existing case for a supermassive black hole at the center of a normal-type galaxy. Well-determined orbital parameters for these seven Sgr A* cluster stars also provide new constraints on how these apparently massive, young (<10 Myr) stars formed in a region that seems to be hostile to star formation. Unlike the more distant He I emission line stars-another population of young stars in the Galactic center-that appear to have coplanar orbits, the Sgr A* cluster stars have orbital properties (eccentricities, angular momentum vectors, and apoapse directions) that are consistent with an isotropic distribution. Therefore, many of the mechanisms proposed for the formation of the He I stars, such as formation from a preexisting disk, are unlikely solutions for the Sgr A* cluster stars. Unfortunately, alternative theories for producing young stars, or old stars that look young, in close proximity to a central supermassive black hole are all also somewhat problematic. Understanding the apparent youth of stars in the Sgr A* cluster, as well as the more distant He I emission line stars, has now become one of the major outstanding issues in the study of the Galactic center.},

The environments we studied, in order of decreasing galaxy density, are the Virgo Cluster, the NGC 1407 Group, the Coma I Group, the Leo Group and the NGC 1023 Group. Our results come from a deep wide-angle survey with the National Astronomical Observatories of Japan Subaru 8-m Telescope on Mauna Kea and are sensitive down to very faint surface-brightness levels. Galaxies were identified as group or cluster members on the basis of their surface brightness and morphology. The faintest galaxies in our sample have R\~{} 22.5. There were thousands of fainter galaxies but we cannot distinguish cluster members from background galaxies at these faint limits so do not attempt to determine a luminosity function fainter than MR=-1010. In all cases, there are far fewer dwarfs than the numbers of low-mass haloes anticipated by cold dark matter theory. The mean logarithmic slope of the luminosity function between MR=-1018 and MR=-1010 is α\~{}=-1.2, far shallower than the cold dark matter mass function slope of α\~{}=-1.8. We would therefore need to be missing about 90 per cent of the dwarfs at the faint end of our sample in all the environments we study to achieve consistency with CDM theory. It is unlikely that such large numbers of dwarfs are missed because (i) the data are deep enough that we are sensitive to very low surface brightness galaxies, and (ii) the seeing is good enough that we can have some confidence in our ability to distinguish high surface brightness dwarfs from background galaxies brighter than R= 22.5. One caveat is that we miss compact members taken to be background galaxies, but such objects (like M32) are thought to be rare.},

EXIST would conduct an all-sky imaging hard X-ray ({\$}\sim{\$}10-600 keV) survey with unprecedented sensitivity: about 5 {\$}\times 10\^{}{\{}-13{\}}{\$} cgs over any factor of 2 bandwidth, or comparable to that achieved at soft X-rays in the ROSAT survey. The proposed angular resolution of 5arcmin, temporal resolution of 10microsec, energy resolution of 1-4 keV over the broad band, and duty cycle of 0.2-0.5 for continuous coverage of any source provide an unprecedented phase space for timing and spectral studies of black holes --from stellar to supermassive, as well as neutron stars and accreting white dwarfs. The large sky coverage allows intrinsically rare events to be studied. One particularly exciting example is the possible detection of tidal disruption of stars near quiescent AGN. Super flares from SGRs could be detected out to the Virgo cluster. The large duty cycle and all sky monitor nature of the mission will enable QPOs from luminous AGN and BH X-ray binaries to be studied on timescales not possible before. I provide an overview of the mission concept and Reference Design, the X-ray timing science prospects for EXIST, and how these might be further optimized in the current Study for EXIST as the BHFP so that EXIST might include many of the desirable features of a next-generation timing mission.},

	N2 = {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code \citep{\{}kravtsov97{\}}, with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated with shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density Lambda CDM universe are reported, with 2563 particles and 4.1x 107 cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 81923. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloe temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

For comparison purposes, some opacity table for the Ross-Aller and Cox-Tabor metal abundances are presented.

Four different cases of redistribution of angular momentum in an evolving star are considered. Evolutionary sequences for a 7-solar-mass star, rotating according to these different cases, were computed from the zero-age main-sequence to the double-shell-source stage. Each sequence was begun with a (typical) equatorial rotational velocity of 210 km/s. On the main sequence, the effects of rotation are of minor importance. However, as the core contracts during later stages, important effects arise in all physically plausible cases. The outer regions of the cores approach critical velocities and develop unstable angular-velocity distributions. The effects of these instabilities should significantly alter the subsequent evolution.},

	N2 = {Destruction of interstellar dust occurs predominantly in supernova shock waves in the warm neutral/ionized medium (density approximately = 0.25/cu cm, temperature approximately = 104 K). Recent theoretical developments and laboratory data for sputtering processes and grain-grain collisional vaporization allows us to better evaluate the grain destruction rate in interstellar shocks in the warm medium. We find that, independent of composition, grain destruction in supernova blast waves is dominated by nonthermal sputtering for shock velocities greater than 50 km/s and less than or equal to 150 km/s and thermal sputtering at higher shock velocities. We use a detailed scheme for the vaporization of grains colliding at high velocities (vs greater than or equal to 20 km/s) and show that the grain-grain collision destruction process is only dominant for shock velocities of less than or equal to 50-80 km/s and is less important than previously assumed. Nevertheless, the grain-grain destruction rates are of order 30{\%}-90{\%} of the sputtering rates at vs greater than 100 km/s and less than 200 km/s and are important in vaporizing the cores of grains. Detailed results for grain destruction as a function of grain size and composition are presented. We also present results for silicon carbide, iron, ice, and porous test particles. For carbonaceous grains we find that the fractional destruction is less than or equal to 0.29, and for silicate it is less than or equal to 0.45, for vs less than or equal to 200 km/s. We have calculated grain lifetimes, using the three-phase model of the interstellar medium, and find lifetimes of 4 x 108 yr for carbonaceous grains and 2.2 x 108 yr for silicate grains. Given that the typical stardust injection timescale of 2.5 x 109 yr, we conclude that efficient mechanisms for grain growth in the interstellar medium must exist in order that a significant fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust, as observed. Therefore, although our improved model has less vaporization of dust due to grain-grain collisions, sputtering still destroys dust efficiently and grain mantle growth in the interstellar medium is required, a conclusion reached in previous models of grain destruction in the interstellar medium. Carbonaceous mantles on silicate grains can protect the silicate cores from sputtering destruction in interstellar shock waves, provided that the protective mantles can efficiently reform in the interstellar medium. Also, if the grains are porous the postshock grain velocities are lower than for solid particles, and grain destruction is reduced. Porosity and mantling may increase the grain lifetime by factors of approximately 3 and approximately 3-4, respectively. The fraction of interstellar silicon in silicate stardust is therefore less than or equal to 0.25, but more silicon might be depleted in the form of a grain mantle.},

	N2 = {We have studied the effects of shattering in grain-grain collisions. Based upon extensive numerical simulation of surface explosions and impacts, an analytical model has been developed which relates the final crater mass and fragment size distribution to the relative collision velocity, grain sizes, and material properties of projectile and target. Our model contains one free parameter, the critical shock pressure for shattering. We have compared the calculated crater masses to laboratory experiments on (sub)micron-sized particle impacts on a wide variety of materials and find good agreement assuming that the critical pressure for shattering is equal to the shear strength of the material. This critical pressure corresponds to minimum collision velocities of ∼1 km s-1 for shattering to occur. The shattering threshold is much smaller than the vaporization threshold, and we therefore conclude that shattering dominates over vaporization in grain-grain collisions. The calculated size distribution of the shattered fragments scales with a a-3.3; slightly less steep than the Mathis, Rumpl, \& Nordsieck (MRN) size distribution. Essentially, any shattering model where the size of the fragments is related to the pressure experienced will lead to fragment power-law size distributions with indices slightly steeper than ∼3. The maximum fragment size increases with increasing crater size (i.e., increasing collision velocity) until the target grain is completely disrupted by the collision. For higher velocity collisions, our theory predicts that the maximum shattered fragment size will decrease again. Dust destruction (return of grain mass to the gas) in the interstellar medium occurs predominantly in shock waves in the warm neutral/ionized medium (density ∼\&eq;0.25 cm-3, temperature ∼104 K). The new theory for grain shattering in grain-grain collisions has been incorporated into a grain destruction code and used to reevaluate the grain destruction rate in interstellar shocks in the warm medium. We find that, for all the grain materials we consider (graphite, silicate, silicon carbide, diamond, iron, and ice) nonthermal and thermal sputtering dominate the grain destruction. We also find that grain disruption (shattering) in grain-grain collisions dominates the grain mass redistribution. We present detailed results for grain destruction as a function of the grain size and composition. In particular, we consider MRN size distributions of silicate and carbonaceous (amorphous carbon/ graphite) grains. We also present results for silicon carbide, diamond, iron, and ice test particles. For both carbonaceous and silicate grains we find that the fractional destruction (i.e., return of solid material to the gas phase) is ≤0.5, for vs ≤200 km s-1 . The grain lifetimes against destruction, assuming the three-phase model of the interstellar medium, are 6 x 108 yr, and 4 x 108 yr, for carbonaceous and silicate grains, respectively, only slightly longer than previous studies that ignored shattering. Grain shattering in grain-grain collisions in shock waves leads to the redistribution of the dust mass from large grains (a ≥1000 {\AA}) into small grains (a < 500 {\AA}). After processing by a single shock, a major fraction of the grains larger than 300 A have experienced shattering grain-grain collisions. The slope of the fragment size distribution produced in single collisions has little influence on the size distribution produced by shocks. Essentially, the resulting grain size distribution is slightly steeper than MRN, because the largest grains move at the highest postshock velocities and hence are preferentially shattered into the smallest fragments. Large grains are lost from the interstellar grain size distribution on time scales less than 108 yr in the warm medium. For 50 km s-1 ≤vs ≤200 km s-1 as much as 5{\%}-15{\%} of the initial grain mass (all grain radii ≥50 {\AA}) may end up in sub-14 {\AA}fragments. Thus, interstellar shocks may be a prodigious source of PAH molecules, PAH clusters, and small grains. Given that the typical stardust injection time scale is 2.5 x 109 yr, we conclude that efficient mechanisms for grain growth, and in particular, the reformation of grains with radii> 1000 {\AA}, must exist in interstellar medium in order that the refractory elements be incorporated in dust and that most of the dust mass is in sizes ≥1000 {\AA}, as observed.},

We compare the results of this model to observed cloud and intercloud depletions of Si, Mg, and Fe and derive dust destruction and accretion rates. The results show that the much lower depletion in the intercloud phase as compared to the cloud phase implies that the dust destruction timescale for Si-bearing dust is comparable to the mixing timescale from the cloud to the intercloud phase and thus much shorter than the stardust injection timescale. The derived average lifetime for Si-bearing dust (6 x 107 yr) is considerably less than theoretical calculations for silicates (3 x 108 yr) predict. Thus, in agreement with other studies, we conclude that a major fraction of the elemental silicon is locked up in a relatively volatile (binding energy, Eb \~{}= 2 eV) dust component. In contrast, the lifetime for Fe-bearing dust (5 x 108 yr) is consistent with a refractory (Eb \~{}= 5 eV) reservoir. Derived accretion rates for these elements are consistent with expected collision rates in diffuse clouds and imply little chemically driven differentiation upon accretion. The implications of these lifetimes for our understanding of the origin and evolution of interstellar dust are briefly examined.},

Corresponding measures in Ca II were also obtained for four stars. This material, together with additional measures obtained previously by other investigators, was employed in a comparison between Na and Ca. For each component N(Na I) and N(Ca II), the numbers of absorbing Na I atoms and Ca II ions in the line of sight, were found whenever possible, as were also the values of the Doppler widths b(Na I) and b(Ca II). For strong components, the data indicate that b(Ca II) in kilometers per second is about 1.5 times b(Na I), in qualitative agreement with Wilson's analysis; but for weaker lines these Doppler widths are more nearly equal. On the average, a decrease occurs in N(Na I)/N(Ca II) as the residual radial velocity of the component increases in absolute value; in low-velocity clouds Na I tends to be more abundant than Ca II, while in high-velocity clouds the reverse is true. This result apparently explains why the strong saturated lines of Na I and Ca II do not lie on the same curve of growth {$[$}b(Ca II) > b(Na I){$]$}. Consideration is given to the possibility that differences of ionization between high-velocity and low-velocity clouds may this variation of abundance ratio with cloud velocity. In a rapidly moving cloud the kinetic temperature should be increased, since the intercloud gas in front of the cloud will be compressed and heated. At a temperature somewhere between 5000$\,^{\circ}$and 10,000$\,^{\circ}$, collisional ionization of Na I by electrons would reduce the ratio N(Na I)/N(Ca II) by the observed factor. However it is uncertain whether the temperature can be so high, and other mechanisms may be important.},

The disk geometry and inclination are known from previous modeling of multiwavelength Hubble Space Telescope images, and we use the SED (0.5μm<=λ<=3 mm) to constrain the dust size distribution. Model spectra are shown for different circumstellar dust models: a standard interstellar medium (ISM) mixture and larger grain models. As compared to ISM grains, the larger dust grain models have a shallower wavelength-dependent opacity: smaller at short wavelengths and larger at long wavelengths. Models with the larger dust grains provide a good match to the observed SED of HH 30 IRS. Although the currently available SED is poorly sampled, we estimate L*\~{}0.2Lsolar, Mdisk\~{}1.5×10-3Msolar, and a power law with exponential cutoff dust grain size distribution. This model provides a good fit to the currently available data, but mid- and far-IR observations are required to more tightly constrain the size distribution. The accretion luminosity in our models is Lacc<\~{}0.2L*, corresponding to an accretion rate M<\~{}4×10-9Msolaryr-1. Dust size distributions that are simple power-law extensions (i.e., no exponential cutoff) yield acceptable fits to the optical/near-IR but too much emission at millimeter wavelengths, and require larger disk masses up to Mdisk\~{}0.5Msolar. Such a simple size distribution would not be expected in an environment such as the disk of HH 30 IRS (i.e., where coagulation and accretion processes are occurring in addition to grain shattering), particularly over such a large range in grain sizes. Its ability to adequately characterize the grain populations, however, may be determined from more complete observational sampling of the SED in the mid- to far-IR.},

	N2 = {Infrared spectroscopy provides a direct handle on the composition and structure of interstellar dust. We have studied the dust along the line of sight toward the Galactic center using Short Wavelength Spectrometer data obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). We focused on the wavelength region from 8 to 13 μm, which is dominated by the strong silicate absorption feature. Using the absorption profiles observed toward Galactic center sources 3 and 4, which are C-rich Wolf-Rayet Stars, as reference objects, we are able to disentangle the interstellar silicate absorption and the silicate emission intrinsic to the source, toward Sgr A* and derive a very accurate profile for the intrinsic 9.7 μm band. The interstellar absorption band is smooth and featureless and is well reproduced using a mixture of 15.1{\%} amorphous pyroxene and 84.9{\%} of amorphous olivine by mass, all in spherical submicron-sized grains. There is no direct evidence for substructure due to interstellar crystalline silicates. By minimizing χ2 of spectral fits to the absorption feature, we are able to determine an upper limit to the degree of crystallinity of silicates in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and conclude that the crystalline fraction of the interstellar silicates is 0.2{\%}+/-0.2{\%} by mass. This is much lower than the degree of crystallinity observed in silicates in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars, the main contributors of dust to the ISM. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, an amorphization process occurs in the ISM on a timescale significantly shorter than the destruction timescale, possibly caused by particle bombardment by heavyweight ions. Second, we consider the possibility that the crystalline silicates in stellar ejecta are diluted by an additional source of amorphous silicates, in particular supernovae. We also compare our results with a study on silicate presolar grains found in interplanetary dust particles. Based on observations with ISO, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.},

An analytical theory is developed for the propagation of shock waves in solids driven by grain-grain collisions, which compares very favorably with detailed numerical calculations. This theory is used to determine the fraction of grain vaporized by a grain-grain collision. Our results predict much less vaporization of colliding grains in interstellar shocks than previous estimates. This theory can also be used to determine the fraction of a colliding grain that melts, shatter, or undergoes a phase transformation to a higher density phase. In particular, the latter two processes can be much more important in interstellar shocks than vaporization. The sputtering of grains by impacting gas ions is reanalyzed based upon extensive laboratory studies and a theoretically derived 'universal'sputtering relation. The analytical results are compared to available experimental studies of sputtering of graphite/amorphous carbon, SiO2, SiC, Fe, and H2O. Sputtering yields for astrophysically relevant materials as a function of impact energy and ion mass are derived. These yields are also averaged over thermal impact spectrum and simple polynomial fits to the resulting yields as a function of temperature are presented. The derived sputtering yields are similar to those adopted in previous studies, except for graphite near threshold where the new yields are much larger due to a lower adopted binding energy. The ion bombardment will amorphitize the surface layers of interstellar grains. It will also convert graphite into hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC) to a depth of 10-20 A. It is suggested that these HAC surfaces are the carriers of the 3.4 micrometer absorption feature in the interstellar medium.},

The method is illustrated using absorption-line data from the IUE satellite for the highly ionized gas toward HD 64760. Additional illustrations and a study of the method's accuracy are provided through a series of numerical simulations of multicomponent interstellar absorption situations. The method is compared to the standard growth curve method for deriving interstellar column densities. The principal value of the apparent optical depth method is that the absorption-line data are directly converted into a form that provides for direct scientific interpretations of the physical conditions in the interstellar absorbing medium as a function of velocity.},

It is found that various mixtures consisting of graphite, silicon carbide, enstatite, olivine, iron, and magnetite are acceptable, that all the acceptable mixtures contain spherical uncoated graphite particles, and that graphite is the main contributor to the 2160-A feature. The required particle-size distribution is shown to be quite broad, with approximately a power-law distribution, for all substances considered. The sizes for graphite are estimated to vary from about 0.005 to about 1 micron, and the observed uniformity of extinction over the sky is explained in terms of a rather uniform power-law exponent, which could have resulted from a stochastic process in grain formation},

Adopting a grain model in which \~{}4{\%} of the cosmic C abundance is in grains with radii <=10 {\AA}, we find that the rate of accretion onto these grains is fast enough to account for the observed large depletions of elements like Ti, without invoking unreasonably high rates of mass transfer between interstellar phases or low grain destruction rates. If these grains are composed of arene rings, then only a limited number of metal atoms can be locked up in them. The depletion would be quenched when this limit is reached, unless there is a mechanism for transferring the metals to larger grains and refreshing the very small grain population-for example, by grain coagulation and shattering in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). If Fe depletes onto the very small grains, then for reasonable coagulation rates there is at least one metal atom per five C atoms in the very small grain population. Furthermore, \~{}60{\%} of the cosmic Fe is associated with the carbonaceous grain population. It is unclear whether this scenario is compatible with observations. However, if there is another population of very small grains, with a large capacity for holding Fe atoms, it might be the sink for the most heavily depleted elements.},

Specific equations for the grain dynamics in the cooling postshock gas are derived. An analytic theory for the propagation of a shock driven into an interstellar cloud by the blast wave of a supernova remnant which sweeps over the cloud is developed. An improved calculation of the grain charge in postshock gas is described, giving a simple analytic approximation for the results. The consequences of including these processes in the numerical code of Seab and Shull (1983) are addressed, including the effect of realistic magnetic fields in low-density gas.},

	N2 = {We have discovered five detached close binary stars out of seven white dwarfs chosen for their low mass (<0.45 Msun). The high success rate of our observations supports the notion that evolution within a binary star is needed to obtain white dwarfs with masses below 0.45 Msun. We have measured the orbital period and radial velocity amplitude of four of our discoveries. No late-type features are seen in any of our targets at a level which forces the mass of any main-sequence companion to be less than 0.1 Msun. This, together with our measured mass functions, implies that the companion stars are in fact white dwarfs. Our observations raise the number of detached, double-degenerate close binaries with known orbital periods from two to six. All of the orbits are circular, a consequence of past interaction. We find periods of 1.1, 3.3 and 4.8 d for 1713+332, 1241-010 and 1317+453. 2331+290 has a very short period, most likely 4h, but with the 1 cycle d-1 alias at 4.8 h also a possibility. Gravitational radiation will cause this star to merge within about 2 ×109 yr. Close double-degenerates go through one or more stages during which the two stars orbit inside a common envelope. The long orbital periods of 1241-010 and 1317+453 suggest that the ejection of the envelope during the common-envelope phase is very efficient. The spectrum of the companion is directly detectable in 1713+332 but in none of the other systems.},

The last mass transfer phase in their evolution must have been a spiral-in. In the formalism proposed by ?), we can constrain the efficiency of the deposition of orbital energy into the envelope to be 1 < \~{} α< \~{} 6, for an envelope structure parameter λ= 0.5. We find that the two standard mass transfer types (stable mass transfer and spiral-in) are both unable to explain the first phase of mass transfer for these three binaries. We use a parametric approach to describe mass transfer in low-mass binaries, where both stars are of comparable mass and find that the orbital characteristics of the observed double helium white dwarfs can be well reproduced if the envelope of the primary is lost with \~{}1.5 times the specific angular momentum of the initial binary. In this case no substantial spiral-in occurs.},

Results are found for compositions in the range Y(MS) between 0.20 and 0.30 and Z between 0.004 and 0.04. The transition mass M(HeF) increases as either Y(MS) decreases or Z increases. The stellar population transition age t(HeF) is virtually independent of composition and close to 0.6 Gyr. The RGB phase transition occurs almost abruptly over a mass range of only a few tenths of a solar mass or, equivalently, over a time interval of about 0.2 Gyr in the life of a stellar population. During the RGB phase transition the core mass Mc at helium ignition increases very rapidly by about 0.15 solar mass, while the luminosity at the tip of the RGB increases by about one order of magnitude. Absolute minima are found for the values of Mc and the RGB tip luminosity.},

Mass transfer evolutions are presented for two different initial configurations: a dynamically unstable binary with initial mass ratio (donor/accretor) q0=1.3 that leads to a complete merger in \~{}10 orbits, and a double-degenerate binary with initial mass ratio q0=0.5 that, after some initial unstable growth of mass transfer, tends to separate as the mass transfer rate levels off.},

	N2 = {We review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation---turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity---are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

	N2 = {We present the results of a deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) exposure of the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397, focussing attention on the cluster's white dwarf cooling sequence. This sequence is shown to extend over 5 mag in depth, with an apparent cutoff at magnitude F814W\~{}27.6. We demonstrate, using both artificial star tests and the detectability of background galaxies at fainter magnitudes, that the cutoff is real and represents the truncation of the white dwarf luminosity function in this cluster. We perform a detailed comparison between cooling models and the observed distribution of white dwarfs in color and magnitude, taking into account uncertainties in distance, extinction, white dwarf mass, progenitor lifetimes, binarity, and cooling model uncertainties. After marginalizing over these variables, we obtain values for the cluster distance modulus and age of μ0=12.02+/-0.06 and Tc=11.47+/-0.47 Gyr (95{\%} confidence limits). Our inferred distance and white dwarf initial-final mass relations are in good agreement with other independent determinations, and the cluster age is consistent with, but more precise than, prior determinations made using the main-sequence turnoff method. In particular, within the context of the currently accepted ΛCDM cosmological model, this age places the formation of NGC 6397 at a redshift z\~{}3, at a time when the cosmological star formation rate was approaching its peak.

	N2 = {We investigate in detail the white dwarf cooling sequence of the globular cluster Messier 4. In particular, we study the influence of various systematic uncertainties, both observational and theoretical, on the determination of the cluster age from the white dwarf cooling sequence. These include uncertainties in the distance to the cluster and the extinction along the line of sight, as well as the white dwarf mass, envelope, and core compositions and the white dwarf-main-sequence mass relation. We find that fitting to the full two-dimensional color-magnitude diagram offers a more robust method for age determination than the traditional method of fitting the one-dimensional white dwarf luminosity function. After taking into account the various uncertainties, we find a best-fit age of 12.1 Gyr, with a 95{\%} lower limit of 10.3 Gyr. We also perform fits using two other sets of cooling models from the literature. The models of Chabrier et al. yield an encouragingly similar result, although the models of Salaris et al. do not provide as good a fit. Our results support our previous determination of a delay between the formation of the Galactic halo and the onset of star formation in the Galactic disk.

We give an overview of the project and follow-up results. The sample is used for two tests of the contemporary picture of close binary evolution leading to DDs. It is shown that the SPY observations of low mass He-core WDs (HeWDs) are inconsistent with the idea that they all reside in close binary systems. We carry out a model atmosphere analysis of WDs residing in double-lined binaries and estimate individual cooling ages. For a number of systems the younger (and hotter) component is the less massive one, as expected. However, for some systems the mass ratio is inverted.},

A satisfactory agreement with observations of the local sample of white dwarfs is achieved if we assume that the initial binary fraction is \~{} 50{\%} and that the lowest mass white dwarfs (M < 0.3 Msun) cool faster than the most recently published cooling models predict. With this model we find a Galactic birth rate of close double white dwarfs of 0.05 yr-1, a birth rate of AM CVn systems of 0.005 yr-1, a merger rate of pairs with a combined mass exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (which may be progenitors of SNe Ia) of 0.003 yr-1 and a formation rate of planetary nebulae of 1 yr-1. We estimate the total number of double white dwarfs in the Galaxy as 2.5 108. In an observable sample with a limiting magnitude Vlim = 15 we predict the presence of \~{} 855 white dwarfs of which \~{} 220 are close pairs. Of these 10 are double CO white dwarfs of which one has a combined mass exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit and will merge within a Hubble time.},

	N2 = {We present a new mechanism for Type Ia supernova explosions in massive white dwarfs. The scenario follows from relaxing assumptions of symmetry and involves a detonation born near the stellar surface. The explosion begins with an essentially central ignition of a deflagration that results in the formation of a buoyancy-driven bubble of hot material that reaches the stellar surface at supersonic speeds. The bubble breakout laterally accelerates fuel-rich outer stellar layers. This material, confined by gravity to the white dwarf, races along the stellar surface and is focused at the location opposite to the point of the bubble breakout. These streams of nuclear fuel carry enough mass and energy to trigger a detonation just above the stellar surface that will incinerate the white dwarf and result in an energetic explosion. The stellar expansion following the deflagration redistributes mass in a way that ensures production of intermediate-mass and iron group elements with ejecta having a strongly layered structure and a mild amount of asymmetry following from the early deflagration phase. This asymmetry, combined with the amount of stellar expansion determined by details of the evolution (principally the energetics of deflagration, timing of detonation, and structure of the progenitor), can be expected to create a family of mildly diverse Type Ia supernova explosions.},

We conduct a survey of asymmetric ignition configurations initiated at various distances from the stellar center. In all cases studied, we find that only a small amount of stellar fuel is consumed during deflagration phase, no explosion is obtained, and the released energy is mostly wasted on expanding the progenitor. Products of the failed deflagration quickly reach the stellar surface, polluting and strongly disturbing it. These disturbances eventually evolve into small and isolated shock-dominated regions that are rich in fuel. We consider these regions as seeds capable of forming self-sustained detonations that, ultimately, result in the thermonuclear supernova explosion. Preliminary nucleosynthesis results indicate that the model supernova ejecta are typically composed of about 0.1-0.25 Msolar of silicon group elements and 0.9-1.2 Msolar of iron group elements and are essentially carbon-free. The ejecta have a composite morphology, are chemically stratified, and display a modest amount of intrinsic asymmetry. The innermost layers are slightly egg shaped with the axis ratio \~{}1.2-1.3 and dominated by the products of silicon burning. This central region is surrounded by a shell of silicon group elements. The outermost layers of ejecta are highly inhomogeneous and contain products of incomplete oxygen burning with only small admixture of unburned stellar material. The explosion energies are \~{}(1.3-1.5)×1051 ergs.},

The nature of the explosion is subject to some debate, but most models begin with a deflagration born near the center of the white dwarf. The evolution of the thermonuclear flame critically depends on the details of the nuclear burning. We present a series of studies of nuclear burning at densities and temperatures found in Type Ia SNe environments. We present the energetics and timescales for burning from C/O through Si group elements and on to nuclear statistical equilibrium. The goal of this work is to calibrate a model flame for use in simulations of Type Ia supernovae.

The nature of shell oxygen burning in a massive star, prior to core collapse, is used as a first example; it is of particular interest because it is (1) the region in which Ni-56 will be produced by the supernova shock, (2) the region of the 'mass cut', which will separate the collapsed core from the ejected mantle, (3) the site of much of the explosive nucleosynthesis, and (4) a suggested source of symmetry breaking to drive mixing instabilities which were observed in SN 1987A. The nature of the shell burning affects the size of the core which will collapse. The method is illustrated on this test case, and the character of the convection is examined.},

Mass transfer in red giant - neutron star binary systems is used as a specific example of such mass transfer, and is investigated. Hjellming \& Webbink's (1987) results on the dynamic timescale response of a convective star with a core to mass loss are applied, with new results. It is found that mass transfer is usually stable, as long as the wind's specific angular momentum does not exceed the angular momentum per reduced mass of the system. This holds for both dynamical and thermal timescales. Those systems which are not stable will usually transfer mass on the thermal timescale. Included are graphs illustrating the variation of (dln(r{\_}L{\_}))/(dln(m))=ζ{\_}L{\_} with mass ratio in the binary, for various parameters in the non-conservative mass transfer, as well as evolutionary paths of interacting red giant neutron star binaries.},

If true, this might indicate that close, detached, double white dwarfs are able to survive the onset of mass transfer caused by gravitational wave radiation and emerge as the semi-detached, hydrogen-deficient stars known as the AM CVn stars. The accreting white dwarfs in such systems are large compared to the orbital separations. This has two effects. First, it makes it likely that the mass-transfer stream can hit the accretor directly. Secondly, it causes a loss of angular momentum from the orbit which can destabilize the mass transfer unless the angular momentum lost to the accretor can be transferred back to the orbit. The effect of the destabilization is to reduce the number of systems which survive mass transfer by as much as one hundredfold. In this paper we analyse this destabilization and the stabilizing effect of a dissipative torque between the accretor and the binary orbit. We obtain analytical criteria for the stability of both disc-fed and direct impact accretion, and we carry out numerical integrations to assess the importance of secondary effects, the chief one being that otherwise stable systems can exceed the Eddington accretion rate. We show that to have any effect upon survival rates, the synchronizing torque must act on a time-scale of the order of 1000 yr or less. If synchronization torques are this strong, then they will play a significant role in the spin rates of white dwarfs in cataclysmic variable stars as well.},

	N2 = {Type Ia supernovae are believed to be white dwarfs disrupted by a thermonuclear explosion. Here we investigate the scenario in which a rather low-mass, carbon-oxygen (C + O) white dwarf accumulates helium on its surface in a sufficient amount for igniting a detonation in the helium shell before the Chandrasekhar mass is reached. In principle, this can happen on white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion or by merging a C + O white dwarf with a low-mass helium one. In this scenario, the helium detonation is thought to trigger a secondary detonation in the C + O core. It is therefore called the ``double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar''supernova model. By means of a set of numerical simulations, we investigate the robustness of this explosion mechanism for generic 1-{\{}M{\_}{\.o}{\}} models and analyze its observable predictions. Also a resolution dependence in numerical simulations is analyzed. Hydrodynamic simulations of the double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar scenario are conducted in two and three spatial dimensions. The propagation of thermonuclear detonation fronts, both in helium and in the carbon-oxygen mixture, is computed by means of both a level-set function and a simplified description for nuclear reactions. The decision whether a secondary detonation is triggered in the white dwarf's core or not is made based on criteria given in the literature. In a parameter study involving different initial flame geometries for He-shell masses of 0.2 and 0.1 {\{}M{\_}{\.o}{\}} (and thus 0.8 and 0.9 {\{}M{\_}{\.o}{\}} of C + O), we find that a secondary detonation ignition is a very robust process. Converging shock waves originating from the detonation in the He shell generate the conditions for a detonation near the center of the white dwarf in most of the cases considered. Finally, we follow the complete evolution of three selected models with 0.2 {\{}M{\_}{\.o}{\}} of He through the C/O-detonation phase and obtain 56Ni-masses of about 0.40 to 0.45 {\{}M{\_}{\.o}{\}}. Although we have not done a complete scan of the possible parameter space, our results show that sub-Chandrasekhar models are not good candidates for normal or sub-luminous type Ia supernovae. The chemical composition of the ejecta features significant amounts of 56Ni in the outer layers at high expansion velocities, which is inconsistent with near-maximum spectra.},

	N2 = {The flame born in the deep interior of a white dwarf that becomes a Type Ia supernova is subject to several instabilities, the combination of which determines the observational characteristics of the explosion. We briefly review these instabilities and discuss the length scales for which each dominates. Their cumulative effect is to accelerate the speed of the flame beyond its laminar value, but that acceleration has uncertain time and angle dependence which has allowed numerous solutions to be proposed (e.g., deflagration, delayed detonation, pulsational deflagration, and pulsational detonation). We discuss the conditions necessary for each of these events and the attendant uncertainties. A grid of critical masses for detonation in the range 107--2 x 109 g cm-3 is calculated and its sensitivity to composition explored. The conditions for prompt detonation are discussed. Such explosions are physically improbable and appear unlikely on observational grounds. Simple deflagrations require some means of boosting the flame speed beyond what currently exists in the literature. "Active turbulent combustion" and multipoint ignition are presented as two plausible ways of doing this. A deflagration that moves at the "Sharp-Wheeler" speed, 0.1geff t, is calculated in one dimension and shows that a healthy explosion is possible in a simple deflagration if fuel can be efficiently burned behind a front that moves with the speed of the fastest floating bubbles generated by the nonlinear Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The relevance of the transition to the "distributed regime" of turbulent nuclear burning is discussed for delayed and pulsational detonations. This happens when the flame speed has slowed to the point that turbulence can actually penetrate the flame thickness and may be advantageous for producing the high fuel temperatures and gentle temperature gradients necessary for detonation. No model emerges without difficulties, but detonation in the distributed regime is plausible, will produce intermediate-mass elements, and warrants further study. The other two leading models, simple deflagration and pulsational detonation, are mutually exclusive.},

Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space ito cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.},

The analysis uses the error-in-variables method of parameter estimation, which accounts not only for the variance of the sample when drawn from a parent distribution, but also for errors in the mass measurements. Testing the method shows that it recovers the underlying properties of cumulative mass distribution without bias while accurately reflecting uncertainties in the parameters. Clouds in the inner disk of the Milky Way follow a truncated power-law distribution with index γ=-1.5+/-0.1 and maximum mass of 106.5 Msolar. The distributions of cloud mass for the outer Milky Way and M33 show significantly steeper indices (γOMW=-2.1+/-0.2 and γM33=-2.9+/-0.4, respectively), with no evidence of a cutoff. The mass distribution of clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud has a marginally steeper distribution than the inner disk of the Milky Way (γ=-1.7+/-0.2) and also shows evidence of a truncation, with a maximum mass of 106.5 Msolar. The mass distributions of molecular clouds vary dramatically across the Local Group, even after accounting for the systematic errors that arise in comparing heterogeneous data and catalogs. These differences should be accounted for in studies that aim to reproduce the molecular cloud mass distributions, or in studies that use the mass spectrum as a parameter in a model.},

	N2 = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code AREPO, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.},

	N2 = {The Lyman decrement associated with the cumulative effect of HI in QSO absorption systems along the line of sight provides a distinctive feature for identifying galaxies at z>\~{}2.5. Colour criteria, which are sensitive to the presence of a Lyman continuum break superposed on an otherwise flat UV spectrum, have been shown, through Keck spectroscopy, to successfully identify a substantial population of star-forming galaxies at 3<\~{}z<\~{}3.5. Such objects have proven to be surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation between high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies. From the HDF images we construct a sample of star-forming galaxies at 2<\~{}z<\~{}4.5. While none of the \~{}60 objects in the HDF having known Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0<\~{}z<\~{}1.4 is found to contaminate our high-redshift sample, our colour criteria are able to efficiently select the 2.6<\~{}z<\~{}3.2 galaxies identified by Steidel et al. The ultraviolet (and blue) dropout technique opens up the possibility of investigating cosmic star and element formation in the early Universe. We set a lower limit to the ejection rate of heavy elements per unit comoving volume from Type II supernovae at <z>=2.75 of \~{}=3.6x10\^{}-4 M{\_}solar yr\^{}-1 Mpc\^{}-3 (for q{\_}0=0.5 and H{\_}0=50 km s\^{}-1 Mpc\^{}-1), which is 3 times higher than the local value but still 4 times lower than the rate observed at z\~{}=1. At <z>=4, our lower limit to the cosmic metal ejection rate is \~{}=3 times lower than the <z>=2.75 value. We discuss the implications of these results on models of galaxy formation, and on the chemical enrichment and ionization history of the intergalactic medium.},

	N2 = {We present an analysis of the hydrodynamic stability of a cold slab bounded by two accretion shocks. Previous numerical work (Hunter et al. 1986; Stevens, Blondin, \& Pollack 1992) has shown that when the Mach number of the shock is large, the slab is unstable. Here we show that to linear order both the bending and breathing modes of such a slab are stable, with a real frequency of cs k, where k is the transverse wavenumber. However, nonlinear effects will tend to soften the restoring forces for bending modes, and when the slab displacement is comparable to its thickness this gives rise to a nonlinear instability. The growth rate of the instability, above this threshold but for small bending angles, is approximately cs k(k eta)1/2, where eta is the slab displacement. When the bending angle is large (i.e., k eta of order unity) the slab will contain a local vorticity comparable to cs/L, where L is the slab thickness. We discuss the relationship between this work and previous studies of shock instabilities, including the implications of this work for gravitational instabilities of slabs. Finally, we examine the cases of a decelerating slab bounded by a single shock and a stationary slab bounded on one side by thermal pressure. The latter case is stable, but appears to be a special case. The former case is subject to a nonlinear overstability driven by deceleration effects. We conclude that shock-bounded slabs with a high-density compression ratio generically produce substructure with a strong local shear, a bulk velocity dispersion like the sound speed in the cold layer, and a characteristic scale comparable to the slab thickness. We discuss the implications of this work for cosmology and the interstellar medium.},

	N2 = {The morphology and kinematics of molecular clouds (MCs) are best explained as the consequence of supersonic turbulence. Supersonic turbulence fragments MCs into dense sheets, filaments, and cores and large low-density ``voids,'' via the action of highly radiative shocks. We refer to this process as turbulent fragmentation. In this work we derive the mass distribution of gravitationally unstable cores generated by the process of turbulent fragmentation. The mass distribution above 1 Msolar depends primarily on the power spectrum of the turbulent flow and on the jump conditions for isothermal shocks in a magnetized gas. For a power spectrum index β=1.74, consistent with Larson's velocity dispersion-size relation as well as with new numerical and analytic results on supersonic turbulence, we obtain a power-law mass distribution of dense cores with a slope equal to 3/(4-β)=1.33, consistent with the slope of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Below 1 Msolar, the mass distribution flattens and turns around at a fraction of 1 Msolar, as observed for the stellar IMF in a number of stellar clusters, because only the densest cores are gravitationally unstable. The mass distribution at low masses is determined by the probability distribution of the gas density, which is known to be approximately lognormal for an isothermal turbulent gas. The intermittent nature of the turbulent density distribution is thus responsible for the existence of a significant number of small collapsing cores, even of substellar mass. Since turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable in supersonically turbulent molecular clouds, and given the success of the present model in predicting the observed shape of the stellar IMF, we conclude that turbulent fragmentation is essential to the origin of the stellar IMF.},

	N2 = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>\~{}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc\~{}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass σ\~{}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc\~{}0.2 Msolar and σ\~{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD\~{}n*\~{}0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >\~{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc\~{}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \~{}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

This formalism provides a framework for convective models that guarantees consistency for the chemistry and the energy budget in the flows, allows time dependence and accounts for the interaction of the convective motions with the global contraction or expansion of the star. In the one-stream limit, the formalism reproduces several existing convective models and allows them to treat the chemistry in the flows. We suggest a version of the formalism that can be implemented easily in a stellar evolution code. We then apply the formalism to convective Urca cores in Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs and compare it to previous studies. We demonstrate that, in degenerate matter, nuclear reactions which change the number of electrons strongly influence the convective velocities, and we show that the net energy budget is sensitive to the mixing. We illustrate our model by computing stationary convective cores with Urca nuclei. Even a very small mass fraction of Urca nuclei (as little as 10-8) strongly influences the convective velocities. We conclude that the proper modelling of the Urca process is essential for determining the ignition conditions for the thermonuclear runaway in Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs.},

We have found that weak interactions during this time increase the neutron excess by an amount that depends on the total quantity of carbon burned prior to the explosion. This contribution is in addition to the metallicity (Z) dependent neutronization through the 22Ne abundance (as studied by Timmes, Brown, \& Truran). The main consequence is that we expect a ``floor'' to the level of neutronization that dominates over the metallicity contribution when Z/Zsolar<\~{}2/3, and it can be important for even larger metallicities if substantial energy is lost to neutrinos via the convective Urca process. This would mask any correlations between SN Ia properties and galactic environments at low metallicities. In addition, we show that recent observations of the dependences of SNe Ia on galactic environments make it clear that metallicity alone cannot provide for the full observed diversity of events.},

	N2 = {We explore the idea that the observed variations in the peak luminosities of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) originate in part from a scatter in metallicity of the main-sequence stars that become white dwarfs. Previous numerical studies have not self-consistently explored metallicities greater than solar. One-dimensional Chandrasekhar mass models of SNe Ia produce most of their 56Ni in a burn to nuclear statistical equilibrium between the mass shells 0.2 and 0.8 Msolar, for which the electron-to-nucleon ratio Ye is constant during the burn. We show analytically that under these conditions, charge and mass conservation constrain the mass of 56Ni produced to depend linearly on the original metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor. Detailed postprocessing of W7-like models confirms this linear dependence. The effect that we have identified is most evident at metallicities larger than solar and is in agreement with previous self-consistent calculations over the metallicity range common to both calculations. The observed scatter in the metallicity (1/3-3 Zsolar) of the solar neighborhood is enough to induce a 25{\%} variation in the mass of 56Ni ejected by SNe Ia. This is sufficient to vary the peak V-band brightness by {$|$}ΔMV{$|$}\~{}0.2. This scatter in metallicity is present out to the limiting redshifts of current observations (z<\~{}1). Sedimentation of 22Ne can possibly amplify the variation in 56Ni mass to <\~{}50{\%}. Further numerical studies can determine if other metallicity-induced effects, such as a change in the mass of the 56Ni-producing region, offset or enhance the variation that we identify.},

In addition, observations of SN I also indicate the existence of appreciable amounts of intermediate elements like O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca in the outer layers of the exploding star. In an earlier paper it was shown that such an abundance pattern can be produced by carbon deflagration models of accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binary systems or stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) which ignite central carbon burning explosively. In the present study, explosive nucleosynthesis results of those carbon deflagration supernovae are presented in detail. Special emphasis is given to the discussion of burning conditions and corresponding nucleosynthesis products, and the nuclear uncertainties which govern the amount of electron captures in the central part of the core. The latter gives constraints on the isotopic composition of the iron peak elements. The overproduction of Fe-54 + Ni-58 is still occurring. Assuming that SN I which contributed to the abundances in the solar system originated from white dwarfs with a metallicity range Z/solar-Z = 0.1-1, might remove this overproduction. This would allow for SN I to be the major contributors of Fe-group nuclei in galactic nucleosynthesis.},

	N2 = {We review the current state of our knowledge concerning the rotation and angular momentum evolution of young stellar objects and brown dwarfs from a primarily observational viewpoint. There has been a tremendous growth in the number of young, low-mass objects with measured rotation periods over the last five years, due to the application of wide field imagers on 1-2-m-class telescopes. Periods are typically accurate to 1{\%} and available for about 1700 stars and 30 brown dwarfs in young clusters. Discussion of angular momentum evolution also requires knowledge of stellar radii, which are poorly known for pre-main-sequence stars. It is clear that rotation rates at a given age depend strongly on mass; higher-mass stars (0.4-1.2 solar mass) have longer periods than lower-mass stars and brown dwarfs. On the other hand, specific angular momentum is approximately independent of mass for low-mass pre-main-sequence stars and young brown dwarfs. A spread of about a factor of 30 is seen at any given mass and age. The evolution of rotation of solar-like stars during the first 100 m.y. is discussed. A broad, bimodal distribution exists at the earliest observable phases (\~{}1 m.y.) for stars more massive than 0.4 solar mass. The rapid rotators (50-60{\%} of the sample) evolve to the ZAMS with little or no angular momentum loss. The slow rotators continue to lose substantial amounts of angular momentum for up to 5 m.y., creating the even broader bimodal distribution characteristic of 30-120-m.y.-old clusters. Accretion disk signatures are more prevalent among slowly rotating PMS stars, indicating a connection between accretion and rotation. Disks appear to influence rotation for, at most, \~{}5 m.y., and considerably less than that for the majority of stars. This time interval is comparable to the maximum lifetime of accretion disks derived from near-infrared studies, and may be a useful upper limit to the time available for forming giant planets. If the dense clusters studied so far are an accurate guide, then the typical solar-like star may have only \~{}1 m.y. for this task. There is less data available for very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs but the indication is that the same mechanisms are influencing their rotation as for the solar-like stars. However, it appears that both disk interactions and stellar winds are less efficient at braking these objects. We also review our knowledge of the various types of variability of these objects over as broad a mass range as possible with particular attention to magnetically induced cool spots and magnetically channeled variable mass accretion.},

	N2 = {An unbiased sample of 164 primary G-dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood are studied with the aid of 4200 radial velocities obtained during almost 13 yrs. Several present-day distributions of the orbital elements are derived. For systems with M(2)/M(1) above 0.1 in the nearby G-dwarf sample, the following results are obtained: (1) The orbital period distribution is unimodal and can be approximated by a Gaussian-type relation with a median period of 180 yrs. (2) The short binaries are circularized up to orbital periods of about 11 d due to the tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the Galactic disk. (3) The tight binaries not affected by tidal effects (in the range between 11 and 1000 d) may reflect the initial binary formation process, and they have a mean eccentricity of 0.31 +/-0.04. For systems with M(2)/M(1) not greater than 0.1, the proportion of brown dwarf companions among the IAU velocity standards is estimated at 10 percent of the primaries, a value in good agreement with that found in the G-dwarf sample.},

We combine these data with one previous field determination in order to compare our observed field strengths with the field strengths predicted by magnetospheric accretion models. We use literature data on the stellar mass, radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate to predict the field strength that should be present on each of our stars according to these magnetospheric accretion models. We show that our measured field values do not correlate with the field strengths predicted by simple magnetospheric accretion theory. We also use our field strength measurements and literature X-ray luminosity data to test a recent relationship expressing X-ray luminosity as a function of surface magnetic flux derived from various solar feature and main-sequence star measurements. We find that the T Tauri stars we have observed have weaker than expected X-ray emission by over an order of magnitude on average using this relationship. We suggest the cause for this is actually a result of the very strong fields on these stars, which decreases the efficiency with which gas motions in the photosphere can tangle magnetic flux tubes in the corona.},

The shallower slope found by the latter authors (3.75 vs. 4.8) is due partly to the use of a regression algorithm that ignores measurement errors and partly to the value of the velocity dispersion adopted for a single galaxy, the Milky Way. A steeper relation is shown to provide a better fit to black hole masses derived from reverberation mapping studies. Combining the stellar dynamical, gasdynamical, and reverberation mapping mass estimates, we derive a best-fit relation M*=1.30(+/-0.36)×108 Msolar(σc/200 km s-1)4.72(+/-0.36).},

	N2 = {We introduce a new computational method for embedding Lagrangian sink particles into a Eulerian calculation. Simulations of gravitational collapse or accretion generally produce regions whose density greatly exceeds the mean density in the simulation. These dense regions require extremely small time steps to maintain numerical stability. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes approach this problem by introducing nongaseous, accreting sink particles, and Eulerian codes may introduce fixed sink cells. However, until now there has been no approach that allows Eulerian codes to follow accretion onto multiple, moving objects. We have removed that limitation by extending the sink particle capability to Eulerian hydrodynamics codes. We have tested this new method and found that it produces excellent agreement with analytic solutions. In analyzing our sink particle method, we present a method for evaluating the disk viscosity parameter αdue to the numerical viscosity of a hydrodynamics code and use it to compute αfor our Cartesian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code. We also present a simple application of this new method: studying the transition from Bondi to Bondi-Hoyle accretion that occurs when a shock hits a particle undergoing Bondi accretion.},

At shock velocities \beta{\_}s\equiv v{\_}s/c\gtrsim 0.1, the shock transition region is far from thermal equilibrium, since the transition crossing time is too short for the production of a black-body photon density (by Bremsstrahlung emission). In this region, electrons and photons (and positrons) are in Compton (pair) equilibrium at temperatures T{\_}s significantly exceeding the far downstream temperature, T{\_}s\gg T{\_}d\approx 2(\varepsilon n{\_}u \hbar\^{}3c\^{}3)\^{}{\{}1/4{\}}. T{\_}s\gtrsim 10 keV is reached at shock velocities \beta{\_}s\approx 0.2. At higher velocities, \beta{\_}s\gtrsim0.6, the plasma is dominated in the transition region by e\^{}\pm pairs and 60 keV\lesssim T{\_}s \lesssim 200 keV. We argue that the spectrum emitted during the breaking out of supernova shocks from the stellar envelopes (or the surrounding winds) of Blue Super Giants and Wolf-Rayet stars, which reach \beta{\_}s>0.1 for reasonable stellar parameters, may include a hard component with photon energies reaching tens or even hundreds of keV. This may account for the X-ray outburst associated with SN2008D, and possibly for other SN-associated outbursts with spectra not extending beyond few 100 keV (e.g. XRF060218/SN2006aj).},

That mass loss itself alters the threshold condition for the onset of dynamical instability of the donor star. We show that, unless the mass of the accreting star is extremely near the Chandrasekhar limit, a significant fraction (exceeding 0.5 for accretors of mass < 1M{\_}sun) must be retained, even when the nominal accretion luminosity far exceeds the Eddington limit. In super-Eddington accretion, the accreted envelope almost certainly extends beyond the orbit of the donor, and will trigger white dwarf merger in a common envelope.},

	N2 = {We study a non-dissipative hydrodynamical mechanism that can stabilize the spin of the accretor in an ultracompact double white dwarf (WD) binary. This novel synchronization mechanism relies on a non-linear coupling between tides and the uniform (or rigid) rotation mode, which spins down the background star. The essential physics of the synchronization mechanism is summarized as follows. As the compact binary coalesces due to gravitational wave emission, the largest star eventually fills its Roche lobe and accretion starts. The accretor then spins up due to infalling material and eventually reaches a spin frequency where a normal mode of the star is resonantly driven by the gravitational tidal field of the companion. If the resonating mode satisfies a set of specific criteria, which we elucidate in this paper, it exchanges angular momentum with the background star at a rate such that the spin of the accretor locks at this resonant frequency, even though accretion is ongoing. Some of the accreted angular momentum that would otherwise spin up the accretor is fed back to the orbit through this resonant tidal interaction. In this paper we solve analytically a simple dynamical system that captures the essential features of this mechanism. Our analytical study allows us to identify two candidate Rossby modes that may stabilize the spin of an accreting WD in an ultracompact binary. These two modes are the l = 4,m = 2 and l = 5,m = 3 Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) unstable hybrid r modes, which, for an incompressible equation of state, stabilize the spin of the accretor at frequency 2.6ωorb and 1.54ωorb, respectively, where ωorb is the binary's orbital frequency. For an n = 3/2 polytrope, the accretor's spin frequency is stabilized at 2.13ωorb and 1.41ωorb, respectively. Since the stabilization mechanism relies on continuously driving a mode at resonance, its lifetime is limited since eventually the mode amplitude saturates due to non-linear mode-mode coupling. Rough estimates of the lifetime of the effect lie from a few orbits to possibly millions of years. We argue that one must include this hydrodynamical stabilization effect to understand stability and survival rate of ultracompact binaries, which is relevant in predicting the Galactic WD gravitational background that LISA will observe.},

	N2 = {The molecular component of the Galaxy is comprised of turbulent, magnetized clouds, many of which are self-gravitating and form stars. To develop an understanding of how these clouds' kinetic and structural evolution may depend on their level of turbulence, mean magnetization, and degree of self-gravity, we perform a survey of direct numerical MHD simulations in which three parameters are independently varied. Our simulations consist of solutions to the time-dependent MHD equations on a two-dimensional grid with periodic boundary conditions; an additional ``half'' dimension is also incorporated as dependent variables in the third Cartesian direction. Two of our survey parameters, the mean magnetization parameter beta=c\^{}2{\_}sound/v\^{}2{\_}Alfven and the Jeans number n{\_}J=L{\_}cloud/L{\_}Jeans, allow us to model clouds that either meet or fail conditions for magneto-Jeans stability and magnetic criticality. Our third survey parameter, the sonic Mach number M=sigma{\_}velocity/c{\_}sound, allows us to initiate turbulence of either sub- or super-Alfv{\'e}nic amplitude; we employ an isothermal equation of state throughout. We evaluate the times for each cloud model to become gravitationally bound and measure each model's kinetic energy loss over the fluid-flow crossing time. We compare the evolution of density and magnetic field structural morphology and quantify the differences in the density contrast generated by internal stresses for models of differing mean magnetization. We find that the values of beta and n{\_}J, but not the initial Mach number M, determine the time for cloud gravitational binding and collapse: for mean cloud density n{\_}H{\_}2=100 cm\^{}-3, unmagnetized models collapse after \~{}5 Myr, and magnetically supercritical models generally collapse after 5-10 Myr (although the smallest magneto-Jeans stable clouds survive gravitational collapse until t\~{}15 Myr), while magnetically subcritical clouds remain uncollapsed over the entire simulations; these cloud collapse times scale with the mean density as t{\_}g\~{}n\^{}-1/2{\_}H{\_}2. We find, contrary to some previous expectations, less than a factor of 2 difference between turbulent decay times for models with varying magnetic field strength; the maximum decay time, for B\~{}14 muG and n{\_}H{\_}2=100 cm\^{}-3, is 1.4 flow crossing times t{\_}cross=L/sigma{\_}velocity (or 8 Myr for typical giant molecular cloud parameters). In all models we find turbulent amplification in the magnetic field strength up to at least the level beta{\_}pert=c\^{}2{\_}sound/deltav\^{}2{\_}Alfven=0.1, with the turbulent magnetic energy between 25{\%} and 60{\%} of the turbulent kinetic energy after one flow crossing time. We find that for non-self-gravitating stages of evolution, when clouds have M=5-10, the mass-averaged density contrast magnitudes <log(rho/rho)> are in the range 0.2-0.5, with the contrast increasing both toward low and high beta. Although our conclusions about density statistics may be affected by our isothermal assumption, we note that only the more strongly magnetized models appear to be consistent with estimates of clump/interclump density contrasts inferred in Galactic giant molecular clouds.},

	N2 = {Observations indicate that massive stars in the Galaxy form in regions of very high surface density, Σ\~{}1 g cm-2. Clusters containing massive stars and globular clusters have a column density comparable to this. The total pressure in clouds of such a column density is P/k\~{}108-109 K cm-3, far greater than that in the diffuse interstellar medium or the average in giant molecular clouds. Observations show that massive-star-forming regions are supersonically turbulent, and we show that the molecular cores out of which individual massive stars form are as well. The protostellar accretion rate in such a core is approximately equal to the instantaneous mass of the star divided by the free-fall time of the gas that is accreting onto the star, as described by Stahler, Shu, \& Taam. The star formation time in this turbulent core model for massive-star formation is several times the mean free-fall time of the core out of which the star forms but is about equal to that of the region in which the core is embedded. The high densities in regions of massive-star formation lead to typical timescales for the formation of a massive star of about 105 yr. The corresponding accretion rate is high enough to overcome the radiation pressure due to the luminosity of the star. For the typical case we consider, in which the cores out of which the stars form have a density structure ρ\~{}r-1.5, the protostellar accretion rate grows with time as m*\~{}t. We present a new calculation of the evolution of the radius of a protostar and determine the protostellar accretion luminosity. At the high accretion rates that are typical in regions of massive-star formation, protostars join the main sequence at about 20 Msolar. We apply these results to predict the properties of protostars thought to be powering several observed hot molecular cores, including the Orion hot core and W3(H2O). In the appendices we discuss the pressure in molecular clouds and argue that ``logatropic'' models for molecular clouds are incompatible with observation.},

The protostar is modeled as being built up from a spherically symmetric accretion flow, with a constant mass accretion rate of 0.00001 solar mass/yr. The protostar is initially fully convective due to the steady state burning of deuterium near its center. The mass-radius relation during this phase is derived analytically. At 2.4 solar masses, a radiative barrier appears which prevents the convective transport of deuterium to the center. The subsurface shell is ignited by the deuterium, which causes the protostar to swell. The star joins the zero-age main sequence by the time it reaches 8 solar masses. It is found that over a significant mass range, protostars contain a substantial amount of deuterium, and it is inferred that the ignition of this fuel during subsequent premain-sequence contraction could drive the surface convection that is apparently present in many Herbig Ae and Be stars.},

A new class of similarity solutions has been found, to add to the solutions obtained earlier by Larson, Penston, and Shu. Numerical integrations of collapses were performed to study their resemblance to the similarity solutions. None of the collapses studied showed any strong tendency to a similarity solution. Computed behaviors were generally intermediate between those described by similarity solutions, with the Larson-Penston solution giving the best description of the flow in the immediate neighborhood of the point of core formation. It was also found that perturbed gravitationally unstable spheres do not necessarily collapse; they may instead perform periodic oscillations of large amplitude.},

The mechanism is illustrated by a self-similar MHD solution, with the gas being regarded as cold and starting from rest at the equatorial plane, with the disk itself in Keplerian orbit about a black hole. It is shown that a centrifugally driven outflow of matter from the disk is possible if the poloidal component of the magnetic field makes an angle of less than 60 deg with disk surface. At large distances the outflow forms a pair of collimated, antiparallel jets, while close to the disk it is probably driven by gas pressure in a hot, magnetically dominated corona.},

This layer reemits directly to space about half the stellar energy it absorbs. The other half is emitted inward and regulates the interior temperature of the disk. The heated disk flares. As a consequence, it absorbs more stellar radiation, especially at large radii, than a flat disk would. The portion of the spectral energy distribution contributed by the disk is fairly flat throughout the thermal infrared. At fixed frequency, the contribution from the surface layer exceeds that from the interior by about a factor 3 and is emitted at more than an order of magnitude greater radius. Spectral features from dust grains in the superheated layer appear in emission if the disk is viewed nearly face-on.},

Although the data are heterogeneous, we analyze them in a consistent manner to remove the biases introduced by limited sensitivity and resolution, thus obtaining reliable sizes, velocity dispersions, and luminosities. We compare the results obtained in dwarf galaxies with those from the Local Group spiral galaxies. We find that extragalactic GMC properties measured across a wide range of environments are very much compatible with those in the Galaxy. The property that shows the largest variability is their resolved brightness temperature, although even that is similar to the average Galactic value in most sources. We use these results to investigate metallicity trends in the cloud average column density and virial CO-to-H2 factor. We find that these measurements do not accord with simple predictions from photoionization-regulated star formation theory, although this could be due to the fact that we do not sample small enough spatial scales or the full gravitational potential of the molecular cloud. We also find that the virial CO-to-H2 conversion factor in CO-bright GMCs is very similar to Galactic and that the excursions do not show a measurable metallicity trend. We contrast these results with estimates of molecular mass based on far-infrared measurements obtained for the Small Magellanic Cloud, which systematically yield larger masses, and interpret this discrepancy as arising from large H2 envelopes that surround the CO-bright cores. We conclude that GMCs identified on the basis of their CO emission are a unique class of objects that exhibit a remarkably uniform set of properties from galaxy to galaxy.},

It is argued that the similarity solution of Larson and Penston (1969) for the stages before core formation is physically artificial, but the gasdynamic flow subsequent to core formation exhibits self-similar properties. Similarity solutions are determined for the collapse of singular isothermal spheres, minus solutions without critical points are obtained by imposing the condition that the fluid velocities are negligible at the 'initial instant', and an expansion-wave collapse solution is evaluated. The results are illustrated with a numerical example roughly corresponding to conditions appropriate for Bok globules or the central regions of a nonmagnetic molecular cloud. Two possible applications of the solutions are discussed: analyzing the stability to gravitational fragmentation of collapsing pressure-free gas spheres and determining the amount of energy radiated away during protostar formation.},

	N2 = {Massive stars (with mass m* > 8 solar masses M{\.o}) are fundamental to the evolution of galaxies, because they produce heavy elements, inject energy into the interstellar medium, and possibly regulate the star formation rate. The individual star formation time, t*f, determines the accretion rate of the star; the value of the former quantity is currently uncertain by many orders of magnitude, leading to other astrophysical questions. For example, the variation of t*f with stellar mass dictates whether massive stars can form simultaneously with low-mass stars in clusters. Here we show that t*f is determined by the conditions in the star's natal cloud, and is typically \~{}105yr. The corresponding mass accretion rate depends on the pressure within the cloud-which we relate to the gas surface density-and on both the instantaneous and final stellar masses. Characteristic accretion rates are sufficient to overcome radiation pressure from \~{}100M{\.o}protostars, while simultaneously driving intense bipolar gas outflows. The weak dependence of t*f on the final mass of the star allows high- and low-mass star formation to occur nearly simultaneously in clusters.},

It is shown that the molecular clouds are in or near virial equilibrium and are not confined by pressure equilibrium with a warm or hot phase of interstellar matter. The velocity line width is proportional to the 0.5 power of the size, σv ∝S0.5. A tight relationship, over four orders of magnitude, is found between the cloud dynamical mass, as measured by the virial theorem, and the CO luminosity M ∝(LCO)0.81.

	N2 = {Spectroscopy with the Keck II 10 m telescope and Echelle Spectrograph and Imager is presented for six Virgo Cluster dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies in the absolute magnitude range -15.7<=MV<=-17.2. The mean line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are resolved as a function of radius along the major axis of each galaxy, nearly doubling the total number of dEs with spatially resolved stellar kinematics. None of the observed objects shows evidence of strong rotation; upper limits on vrot/σ, the ratio of the maximum rotational velocity to the mean velocity dispersion, are well below those expected for rotationally flattened objects. Such limits place strong constraints on dE galaxy formation models. Although these galaxies continue the trend of low rotation velocities observed in Local Group dEs, they are in contrast to recent observations of large rotation velocities in slightly brighter cluster dEs. Using surface photometry from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images and spherically symmetric dynamical models, we determine global mass-to-light ratios 3<=ΥV<=6. These ratios are comparable to those expected for an old to intermediate-age stellar population and are broadly consistent with the observed V-I colors of the galaxies. These dE galaxies therefore do not require a significant dark matter component inside an effective radius. We are able to rule out central black holes more massive than \~{}107 Msolar. For the five nucleated dEs in our sample, kinematic and photometric properties were determined for the central nucleus separately from the underlying host dE galaxy. These nuclei are as bright or brighter than the most luminous Galactic globular clusters and lie near the region of fundamental plane space occupied by globular clusters. In this space, the Virgo dE galaxies lie in the same general region as Local Group and other nearby dEs, although nonrotating dEs appear to have a slightly higher mean mass and mass-to-light ratio than rotating dEs; the dE galaxies occupy a plane parallel to, but offset from, that occupied by normal elliptical galaxies. Data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

The main instrument, based on MCP optics with Lobster-eye geometry, has an energy passband from 0.1 to 3.5 keV, an unprecedented daily sensitivity of 2x10\^{}{\{}-12{\}} erg cm\^{}{\{}-2{\}}s{\$}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}, and it is capable to scan, during each orbit, the entire sky with an angular resolution of 4-6 arcmin. This X-ray telescope is flanked by a Gamma Ray Burst Monitor, with the minimum requirement of recognizing true GRBs from other transient events. In this paper we describe the GRBM. In addition to the minimum requirement, the instrument proposed is capable to roughly localize GRBs which occur in the Lobster FOV (162x22.5 degrees) and to significantly extend the scientific capabilities of the main instrument for the study of GRBs and X-ray transients. The combination of the two instruments will allow an unprecedented spectral coverage (from 0.1 up to 300/700 keV) for a sensitive study of the GRB prompt emission in the passband where GRBs and X-Ray Flashes emit most of their energy. The low-energy spectral band (0.1-10 keV) is of key importance for the study of the GRB environment and the search of transient absorption and emission features from GRBs, both goals being crucial for unveiling the GRB phenomenon. The entire energy band of Lobster-ISS is not covered by either the Swift satellite or other GRB missions foreseen in the next decade.},

Most of the baryons today are still in the form of ionized gas, which contributes a mean density uncertain by a factor of about 4. Stars and their remnants are a relatively minor component, comprising for our best-guess plasma density only about 17{\%} of the baryons, while populations contributing most of the blue starlight comprise less than 5{\%}. The formation of galaxies and of stars within them appears to be a globally inefficient process. The sum over our budget, expressed as a fraction of the critical Einstein-de Sitter density, is in the range 0.007 <\~{} Omega B <\~{} 0.041, with a best guess of Omega B \~{} 0.021 (at Hubble constant 70 km s-1 Mpc-1). The central value agrees with the prediction from the theory of light element production and with measures of the density of intergalactic plasma at redshift z \~{} 3. This apparent concordance suggests that we may be close to a complete survey of the major states of the baryons.},

Using the line width-luminosity mass scaling relation established for broad-line active nuclei, we estimate black hole masses in the range of MBH\~{}8×(104-106)Msolar, a regime in which only two objects are currently known. The absolute magnitudes are faint for active galactic nuclei, ranging from Mg\~{}-15 to -18 mag, while the bolometric luminosities are all close to the Eddington limit. The entire sample formally satisfies the line width criterion for so-called narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies; however, they display a wider range of Fe II and {$[$}O III{$]$} λ5007 line strengths than is typically observed in this class of objects. Although the available imaging data are of insufficient quality to ascertain the detailed morphologies of the host galaxies, it is likely that the majority of the hosts are relatively late-type systems. The host galaxies have estimated g-band luminosities \~{}1 mag fainter than M* for the general galaxy population at z\~{}0.1. Beyond simply extending the known mass range of central black holes in galactic nuclei, these objects provide unique observational constraints on the progenitors of supermassive black holes.

Using standard virial mass techniques to estimate BH masses, we select from the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey all broad-line active galaxies with masses <2×106 Msolar. BHs in this mass regime provide unique tests of the relationship between BHs and galaxies, since their late-type galaxy hosts do not necessarily contain classical bulges. Furthermore, they provide observational analogs of primordial seed BHs and are expected, when merging, to provide strong gravitational signals for future detectors such as LISA. From our preliminary sample of 19, we have increased the total sample by an order of magnitude to 174, as well as an additional 55 (less secure) candidates. The sample has a median BH mass of <MBH>=1.3×106 Msolar, and in general the objects are radiating at high fractions of their Eddington limits. We investigate the broad spectral properties of the sample; 55 are detected by ROSAT, with soft X-ray luminosities in the range 1040 to 7×1043 ergs s-1. Much like the preliminary sample, these objects are predominantly radio-quiet (R≡f6cm/f4400{\AA}<10), but 11 objects are detected at 20 cm, with radio powers (1021-1023 W Hz-1) that may arise from either star formation or nuclear activity; only 1{\%} of the sample is radio-loud. We further confirm that, with <Mg>=-19.3 and <g-r>=0.7 mag, the host galaxies are low-mass, late-type systems. At least 40{\%} show disklike morphologies, and the combination of host galaxy colors and higher order Balmer absorption lines indicate intermediate-age stellar populations in a subset of the sample.},

Uncertainties in the M*-σrelation have little effect on the mass density. We find a mass density of (4.8+/-1.6)h2×105 Msolar Mpc-3.

Keck 10 m telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short-period star S0-2 provides values for the distance (R0) of 8.0+/-0.6 kpc, the enclosed mass (Mbh) of 4.1+/-0.6×106 Msolar, and the black hole's RV, which is consistent with zero with 30 km s-1 uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining R0=8.4+/-0.4 kpc and Mbh=4.5+/-0.4×106 Msolar. More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3-4×105 Msolar within 0.01 pc, \~{}100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the assumptions regarding the black hole's radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of R0 and the Galaxy's local rotation speed, which it is derived from combining R0 with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*, (θ0=229+/-18 km s-1), are compatible with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in the vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the Mbh-σrelation.},

Knowledge of the frequency of occurrence of black holes, of their masses and spins, is of broad relevance for studying black hole growth and galaxy and active galactic nuclei formation and evolution. It has been suggested that an unavoidable consequence of the existence of supermassive black holes, and the best diagnostic of their presence in nonactive galaxies, would be occasional tidal disruption of stars captured by the black holes. These events manifest themselves in the form of luminous flares powered by accretion of debris from the disrupted star into the black hole. Candidate events among optically nonactive galaxies emerged in the past few years. For the first time, we have looked with high spatial and spectral resolution at one of these most extreme variability events ever recorded among galaxies. Here we report measuring a factor of \~{}200 drop in luminosity of the X-ray source RX J1242-1119 with the X-ray observatories Chandra and XMM-Newton, and perform tests of the favored outburst scenario, tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. We show that the detected ``low-state'' emission has properties such that it must still be related to the flare. The power-law shaped postflare X-ray spectrum indicates a ``hardening'' compared to outburst. The inferred black hole mass, the amount of liberated energy, and the duration of the event favor an accretion event of the form expected from the (partial or complete) tidal disruption of a star.},

HST imaging confirms that the host galaxies have correspondingly low luminosity; they are \~{}1 mag below L*. In terms of morphology, \~{}60{\%} of the members of the sample are disk dominated, and all of these are consistent with containing a bulge or (more likely) pseudobulge, while the remainder are compact systems with no discernible disk component. In general, the compact components of the galaxies do not obey the fundamental plane of giant elliptical galaxies and classical bulges, but rather are less centrally concentrated at a given luminosity, much like spheroidal galaxies. Our results strongly confirm that a classical bulge is not a requirement for a nuclear black hole. At the same time, the observed ratio of black hole to bulge mass is nearly an order of magnitude lower in this sample than that seen for classical bulges. While the MBH-σ* relation appears to continue to low mass, it seems that black hole-galaxy scaling relations do depend on galaxy structure. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program GO-10596.},

While the presence of young stars forming one or two stellar disks at \~{}0.1 pc from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be understood through star formation in accretion disks, the origin of the S stars observed a factor of 10 closer to the SMBH has remained a major puzzle. Here we show the S stars to be a natural consequence of dynamical interaction of two stellar disks at larger radii. Due to precession and Kozai interaction, individual stars achieve extremely high eccentricities at random orientation. Stellar binaries on such eccentric orbits are disrupted due to close passages near the SMBH, leaving behind a single S star on a much tighter orbit. The remaining star may be ejected from the vicinity of the SMBH, thus simultaneously providing an explanation for the observed hypervelocity stars in the Milky Way halo.},

This exceeds galactic escape speeds; hence, unless there is a mechanism to prevent this, one would expect many galaxies that had merged to be without a central black hole. Here we show that in most galactic mergers, torques from accreting gas suffice to align the orbit and spins of both black holes with the large-scale gas flow. Such a configuration has a maximum kick speed <200 km s-1, safely below galactic escape speeds. We predict, however, that in mergers of galaxies without much gas, the remnant will be kicked out several percent of the time. We also discuss other predictions of our scenario, including implications for jet alignment angles and X-type radio sources.},

At the shortest orbital periods (and highest accretion rates, M˙>10-7 Msolar yr-1), the flashes are weak and likely lead to the helium equivalent of classical nova outbursts. However, as the orbit widens and M˙drops, the mass required for the unstable ignition increases, leading to progressively more violent flashes up to a final flash with helium shell mass \~{}0.02-0.1 Msolar. The high pressures of these last flashes allow the burning to produce the radioactive elements 48Cr, 52Fe, and 56Ni that power a faint (MV=-15 to -18) and rapidly rising (few days) thermonuclear supernova. Current galactic AM CVn space densities imply one such explosion every 5,000-15,000 years in 1011 Msolar of old stars (\~{}2{\%}-6{\%} of the Type Ia rate in E/SO galaxies). These ``.Ia'' supernovae (one-tenth as bright for one-tenth the time as a Type Ia supernovae) are excellent targets for deep (e.g., V=24) searches with nightly cadences, potentially yielding an all-sky rate of 1000 per year.},

However, its classification as a globular cluster has been challenged making it a candidate for being the stripped core of an accreted dwarf galaxy; this together with the fact that it has one of the largest velocity dispersions for star clusters in our galaxy makes it an interesting candidate for harboring an intermediate-mass black hole. We measure the surface brightness profile from integrated light on an HST ACS image of the center, and find a central power-law cusp of logarithmic slope -0.08. We also analyze Gemini GMOS-IFU kinematic data for a 5''×5'' field centered on the nucleus of the cluster, as well as for a field 14" away. We detect a clear rise in the velocity dispersion from 18.6 km s-1 at 14" to 23 km s-1 in the center. A rise in the velocity dispersion could be due to a central black hole, a central concentration of stellar remnants, or a central orbital structure that is radially biased. We discuss each of these possibilities. An isotropic, spherical dynamical model implies a black hole mass of 4.0+0.75-1.0×104 Msolar, and excludes the no black hole case at greater than 99{\%} significance. We have also run flattened, orbit-based models and find similar results. While our preferred model is the existence of a central black hole, detailed numerical simulations are required to confidently rule out the other possibilities.},

The length scales pertinent to the initiation of the detonation are notoriously unresolved in multidimensional stellar simulations, prompting the use of results of one-dimensional simulations at higher resolution, such as those performed for this work, as guidelines for deciding whether or not conditions reached in the higher dimensional full star simulations successfully would lead to the onset of a detonation. Spontaneous initiation relies on the existence of a suitable gradient in self-ignition (induction) times of the fuel, which we set up with a spatially localized nonuniformity of temperature---a hot spot. We determine the critical (smallest) sizes of such hot spots that still marginally result in a detonation in WD matter by integrating the reactive Euler equations with the hydrodynamics code FLASH. We quantify the dependences of the critical sizes of such hot spots on composition, background temperature, peak temperature, geometry, and functional form of the temperature disturbance, many of which were hitherto largely unexplored in the literature. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of modeling of SNe Ia.},

	N2 = {Stellar evolution studies suggest that a common progenitor for Type Ia supernovae should be a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in the mass range 0.6 to 0.9 solar mass merging by gravitational radiation with a helium main-sequence star and accreting helium at a rate of several times 10-8 solar mass/yr. Studies of symbiotic variables independently suggest a similar endpoint -- a carbon-oxygen white dwarf that, at the time of nuclear instability has accreted 0.15 to 0.20 solar mass of helium. In such systems helium burns in a detonation wave with such force that a detonation is also ignited in the interior of the dwarf. The entire system is disrupted and a bright display ensues, powered by the decay of Ni-56 synthesized in the explosion. We consider here the outcome of such events, calculating in detail their final composition, velocities, and light curves. The models do not fare badly compared with observations. The iron group nucleosynthesis is acceptable though there are, in some cases, substantial overproductions of Ti-44 and other isotopes of Ti, Cr, and V with respect to iron, suggesting that supernovae of this type are the origin in nature of these isotopes, but only part of the iron. The models tend to be subluminous compared with those based on carbon deflagration in white dwarfs near 1.4 solar mass. Interestingly, though peak luminosities are obtained that vary by up to a factor of 4, the shapes of the light curves and especially their post-peak decline rate are very similar. Future studies of radiation transport, spectral synthesis, and especially multidimensional hydrodynamics will be needed to clarify some of these properties.},

We use a combination of analytic solutions and numerical integrations of the standard orbit-averaged first-order evolution equations, including direct-impact accretion and the evolution of the components due to mass exchange. We include also the effects of mass loss during supercritical (super-Eddington) mass transfer and the tidal and advective exchanges of angular momentum between the binary components. With the caveat that our formalism does not include an explicit treatment of common-envelope phases, our results suggest that a larger fraction of detached double white dwarfs survive the onset of mass transfer than has been hitherto assumed, even if this mass transfer is initially unstable and rises to super-Eddington levels. In addition, as a consequence of the tidal coupling, systems that come into contact near the mass transfer instability boundary undergo a phase of oscillation cycles in their orbital period (and other system parameters). Unless the donor star has a finite entropy such that the effective mass-radius relationship deviates significantly from that of a zero-temperature white dwarf, we expect our results to be valid. Much of the formalism developed here would also apply to other mass-transferring binaries, and in particular to cataclysmic variables and Algol systems.},

Major uncertainties in the current understanding of properties of NSs and BHs most relevant to the GW studies are discussed, including the treatment of the natal kicks which compact stellar remnants acquire during the core collapse of massive stars and the common envelope phase of binary evolution. We discuss the coalescence rates of binary NSs and BHs and prospects for their detections, the formation and evolution of binary WDs and their observational manifestations. Special attention is given to AM CVn-stars - compact binaries in which the Roche lobe is filled by another WD or a low-mass partially degenerate helium-star, as these stars are thought to be the best LISA verification binary GW sources.},

The unresolved gravitational wave (GW) background due to these systems is calculated for the 0.1-10 mHz frequency band of the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). This background is found to be dominated by emission from close white dwarf-white dwarf (WD-WD) pairs. The spectral shape can be understood in terms of some simple analytic arguments. To quantify the astrophysical uncertainties, we construct a range of evolutionary models which produce populations consistent with Galactic observations of close WD-WD binaries. The models differ in binary evolution prescriptions as well as initial parameter distributions and cosmic star formation histories. We compare the resulting background spectra, the shapes of which are found to be insensitive to the model chosen, and different to those found recently by Schneider et al. From this set of models, we constrain the amplitude of the extragalactic background to be 1 ×10-12<\~{}Ωgw(1mHz) <\~{} 6 ×10-12, in terms of Ωgw(f), the fraction of closure density received in gravitational waves in the logarithmic frequency interval around f.},

	N2 = {"Hard" massive black hole (MBH) binaries embedded in steep stellar cusps can shrink via three-body slingshot interactions. We show that this process will inevitably be accompanied by a burst of stellar tidal disruptions, at a rate that can be several orders of magnitude larger than that appropriate for a single MBH. Our numerical scattering experiments reveal that (1) a significant fraction of stars initially bound to the primary hole are scattered into its tidal disruption loss cone by gravitational interactions with the secondary hole, an enhancement effect that is more pronounced for very unequal mass binaries; (2) about 25{\%} (40{\%}) of all strongly interacting stars are tidally disrupted by an MBH binary of mass ratio q = 1/81 (q = 1/243) and eccentricity 0.1; and (3) two mechanisms dominate the fueling of the tidal disruption loss cone, a Kozai nonresonant interaction that causes the secular evolution of the stellar angular momentum in the field of the binary, and the effect of close encounters with the secondary hole that change the stellar orbital parameters in a chaotic way. For a hard MBH binary of 107 M sun and mass ratio 10--2, embedded in an isothermal stellar cusp of velocity dispersion σ* = 100 km s-1, the tidal disruption rate can be as large as {\{}\dot{\{}N{\}}{\}}{\_}*\sim 1\, yr--1. This is 4 orders of magnitude higher than estimated for a single MBH fed by two-body relaxation. When applied to the case of a putative intermediate-mass black hole inspiraling onto Sgr A*, our results predict tidal disruption rates {\{}\dot{\{}N{\}}{\}}{\_}*\sim 0.05-0.1 yr--1.},

To a limiting magnitude of K\~{}16, 9 of 10 stars in the central 0.4", and 13 of 17 stars out to 0.7" from the central black hole have spectral properties of B0-B9 main-sequence stars. Based on the 2.1127 μm He I line width, all brighter early-type stars have normal rotation velocities, similar to solar neighborhood stars. We combine the new radial velocities with SHARP/NACO astrometry to derive improved three-dimensional stellar orbits for six of these ``S stars'' in the central 0.5". Their orientations in space appear random. Their orbital planes are not co-aligned with those of the two disks of massive young stars 1"-10" from Sgr A*. We can thus exclude the hypothesis that the S stars as a group inhabit the inner regions of these disks. They also cannot have been located/formed in these disks and then migrated inward within their planes. From the combination of their normal rotation and random orbital orientations, we conclude that the S stars were most likely brought into the central light-month by strong individual scattering events. The updated estimate of distance to the Galactic center from the S2 orbit fit is R0=7.62+/-0.32 kpc, resulting in a central mass value of (3.61+/-0.32)×106 Msolar. We happened to catch two smaller flaring events from Sgr A* during our spectral observations. The 1.7-2.45 μm spectral energy distributions of these flares are fit by a featureless, ``red'' power law of spectral index α'=-4+/-1 (Sν\~{}να'). The observed spectral slope is in good agreement with synchrotron models in which the infrared emission comes from accelerated, nonthermal, high-energy electrons in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow in the central R\~{}10RS region.

We present a simple analytic model relating the light curve to the internal density structure of the star. We thus show that the standard light curve proportional to t-5/3 only holds at late times. Close to the peak luminosity the light curve is shallower, deviating more strongly from t-5/3 for more centrally concentrated (e.g. solar type) stars. We test our model numerically by simulating the tidal disruption of several stellar models, described by simple polytropic spheres with index γ. The simulations agree with the analytical model given two considerations. First, the stars are somewhat inflated on reaching pericentre because of the effective reduction of gravity in the tidal field of the black hole. This is well described by a homologous expansion by a factor which becomes smaller as the polytropic index becomes larger. Secondly, for large polytropic indices wings appear in the tails of the energy distribution, indicating that some material is pushed further away from parabolic orbits by shocks in the tidal tails. In all our simulations, the t-5/3 light curve is achieved only at late stages. In particular, we predict that for solar-type stars, this happens only after the luminosity has dropped by at least 2mag from the peak. We discuss our results in the light of recent observations of flares in otherwise quiescent galaxies and note the dependence of these results on further parameters, such as the star/hole mass ratio and the stellar orbit.},

Their existence follows from the presence of a mass sink, the MBH, in the galactic center, which drives a flow of stars into nearly radial orbits to replace those it has destroyed. We consider two limits for the stellar response to tidal heating: surface heating with radiative cooling (``hot squeezars'') and bulk heating with adiabatic expansion (``cold squeezars''), and calculate the evolution of the squeezar orbit, size, luminosity, and effective temperature. The squeezar formation rate is only \~{}0.05 that of tidal disruption flares, but squeezar lifetimes are many orders of magnitude longer, and so future observations of squeezars in nearby galaxies can probe the tidal process that feeds MBHs and the effects of extreme tides on stars. The mean number of squeezars orbiting the galactic MBH is estimated at 0.1-1.},

Their masses are found to be tightly linked with the masses and velocity dispersions of their host galaxies. On the other hand, BHs are widely held to constitute the central engines of quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in general. It is however still unclear how BHs have grown, and whether they have co-evolved with their hosts. In this Review I discuss how, in ways independent of specific models, constraints on the growth history of BHs and their host galaxies have been set by matching the statistics of local BHs to the emissivity, number density, and clustering properties of AGNs at different cosmological epochs. I also present some new results obtained through a novel numerical code which evolves the BH mass function and clustering adopting broad distributions of Eddington ratios. I finally review BH evolution in a wider cosmological context, connecting BH growth to galaxy evolution.},

Although the tidal disruption of a star is a rare event in a galaxy, ≈10--4 yr--1, observational candidates have emerged in all-sky X-ray and deep ultraviolet (UV) surveys in the form of luminous UV/X-ray flares from otherwise quiescent galaxies. Here we present the third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Deep Imaging Survey: a 1.6 ×1043 erg s--1 UV/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.1855. The UV/optical spectral energy distribution (SED) during the peak of the flare measured by GALEX and Palomar Large Field Camera imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody with T bb = 1.7 ×105 K and a bolometric luminosity of 3 ×1045 erg s--1, assuming an internal extinction with E(B --V)gas = 0.3. The Chandra upper limit on the X-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, LX (2 --10 keV)<1041 erg s--1, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios of UV to X-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. We compare the light curves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidates discovered by GALEX, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by the power-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted solar-type star and (2) the UV/optical SEDs can be attributed to thermal emission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidal disruption radius of a ≈107 M sun central black hole. We use the observed peak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (--17.5>Mg > --18.9) to predict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.},

As stars diffuse in the cluster, some will inevitable wander sufficiently close to the hole that they suffer tidal disruption. An attractive feature of the IMBH hypothesis is its potential to disrupt not only solar-type stars but also compact white dwarf stars. Attention is given to the fate of white dwarfs that approach the hole close enough to be disrupted and compressed to such an extent that explosive nuclear burning may be triggered. Precise modeling of the dynamics of the encounter, coupled with a nuclear network, allow for a realistic determination of the explosive energy release, and it is argued that ignition is a natural outcome for white dwarfs of all varieties passing well within the tidal radius. Although event rates are estimated to be significantly less than the rate of normal Type Ia supernovae, such encounters may be frequent enough in globular clusters harboring an IMBH to warrant a search for this new class of supernova.},

The idea that black holes of intermediate masses (˜1000M) may exist in globular star clusters has gained credence over recent years but no conclusive evidence has been established yet. An attractive feature of this hypothesis is the potential to not only disrupt solar-type stars but also compact white dwarf stars. In close encounters the white dwarfs can be sufficiently compressed to thermonuclearly explode. The detection of an underluminous thermonuclear explosion accompanied by a soft, transient X-ray signal would be compelling evidence for the presence of intermediate mass black holes in stellar clusters. In this paper we focus on the numerical techniques used to simulate the entire disruption process from the initial parabolic orbit, over the nuclear energy release during tidal compression, the subsequent ejection of freshly synthesized material and the formation process of an accretion disk around the black hole.},

As the number of surrounding stars and their motions are roughly known, the capture rate can be estimated; the question then arises of whether the apparent quiescence of the nuclei of these GCs is compatible with the IMBH's presence. The role of debris from disrupted stars in activating quiescent nuclei of GCs is studied here employing three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. It is argued that when individual stars are disrupted, the bulk of the debris would be swallowed or expelled rapidly compared with the interval between successive disruptions. A transient signal (predominantly of soft X-ray emission) could persist steadily with L \~{} L Edd = 1041(M h/103 M sun) erg s--1 for at most tens of years; thereafter the flare would rapidly fade. While the infall rate declines as t --5/3, some material may be stored for a longer time in an accretion disk. The IMBH luminosity could then remain as high as LX >= 1039 erg s--1 for several hundreds of years after disruption. In a given object, this ultraluminous X-ray activity would have a duty cycle of the order of 10--4. Quiescent GCs, those with IMBHs now starved of fuel, should greatly outnumber active ones; observational constraints would not then be stringent until we had observed enough candidates to constitute a proper ensemble average.},

General formulae are derived; for definiteness, we apply them to the specific case of stars with an n = 3 polytropic structure.

These synthetic spectra have been compared with observed spectra for four stars with known abundances, effective temperatures, and surface gravities. The carbon abundances and carbon isotope ratios found from this comparison agree well with those found from high dispersion spectroscopy. The synthetic spectra have been used to calculate tables of CO indices on two different systems. The observed dependence of CO band strength on luminosity is seen in these synthetic indices. These CO indices have also been used to derive carbon abundances for fifteen field giant stars with known atmospheric parameters. The resulting carbon abundances are again in good agreement with those found from high dispersion spectroscopy. Sample CO spectra are presented for globular cluster giant branches. Calculations of CO colors for different oxygen abundances and with carbon abundances which fit the observed G bands suggest that the oxygen abundance is not enhanced in the red giant stars in the very metal-poor cluster NGC 6397.},

A high-quality SINFONI H- and K-band spectrum obtained from co-adding 23.5 hr of observation between 2004 and 2007 reveals that S2 is an early B dwarf (B0-B2.5 V). Using model atmospheres, we constrain its stellar and wind properties. We show that S2 is a genuine massive star and not the core of a stripped giant star, as sometimes speculated to resolve the problem of star formation so close to the supermassive black hole. We give an upper limit on its mass-loss rate and show that it is He enriched, possibly because of the presence of a magnetic field.

We concentrate on the short-period (P < 1500 s) systems, some of which are expected to be in a phase of direct-impact accretion. Using a self-consistent model for the star-formation history and radial distribution of stars in the Galaxy plus simple models for the emission of optical and X-ray radiation from the AM CVn systems and interstellar absorption, we derive the sample of short-period AM CVn systems that can be detected in the optical and/or X-ray bands. At the shortest periods, the detectable systems are all X-ray sources, some with periods as short as three minutes. At periods above 10 min, most detectable systems are optical sources. About one-third of the X-ray sources are also detectable in the optical band. We also calculate the gravitational-wave signal of the short-period AM CVn systems. We find that potentially several thousand AM CVn systems can be resolved by the gravitational-wave detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), comparable to the expected number of detached double white dwarfs that can be resolved. We estimate that several hundreds of the AM CVn systems resolvable by LISA are also detectable in the optical and/or X-ray bands.},

We consider in particular the case of three hot and massive white dwarfs, PG 0136+251, PG 1658+441, and GD 50, not located in any cluster or association, which have been suggested to result from a coalescence process (Bergeron et al.). We show that the merged object must lose about 90{\%} of its original angular momentum to become sufficiently compact and reach the observed surface gravities log g \~{} 9. Since the three candidates are DA white dwarfs, we examine the efficiency of the accretion process from the interstellar medium to build the observed hydrogen envelope. Finally, the fact that the three merger candidates are located within 80 pc (two within 40 pc) imposes severe constraints on the evolution process. We connect this statistical problem to the evolutionary timescale of the merged object. We show that in order to explain the observed three white dwarfs, the coalescence scenario implies a large timescale.},

	N2 = {We present a new numerical study of the equilibrium and stability properties of close binary systems. We use the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique both to construct accurate equilibrium configurations in three dimensions and to follow their hydrodynamic evolution. We adopt a simple polytropic equation of state p = Krhogamma with gamma = 5/3 and K = constant within each star, applicable to low-mass degenerate dwarfs as well as low-mass main-sequence stars. For degenerate configurations, we set the two polytropic constants equal, K = K prime, independent of the mass ratio. For main-sequence stars, we adjust K and K prime so as to obtain a simple mass-radius relation of the form R/R prime = M/M prime, where R prime and M prime are the radius and mass of the secondary. Along a sequence of binary equilibrium configurations for two identical stars, we demonstrate the existence of both secular and dynamical instabilities, confirming directly the results of recent analytic work. We use the SPH method to calculate the nonlinear development of the dynamical instability and to determine the final fate of the system. We find that the two stars merge together into a single, rapidly rotating object in just a few orbital periods. Equilibrium sequences are also constructed for systems containing two nonidentical stars. These sequences terminate at a Roche limit, which we can determine very accurately using SPH. For two low-mass main-sequence stars with mass ratio q approximately less than 0.4 we find that the (synchronized) Roche limit configuration is secularly unstable. We discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of double white-dwarf systems and W Ursae Majoris binaries.},

	N2 = {The explosive deaths of stars (supernovae; SNe) are generally explained by two physical processes. Young massive stars (more than eight solar masses, M{\_}Sun) undergo gravitational core-collapse and appear as type Ib/c and II SNe. Type Ia SNe result from thermonuclear explosions of older, Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs). Even the most underluminous SNe Ia eject \~{}1 M{\_}Sun of C/O burning products. Here we report our discovery of the faint type Ib SN 2005E in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, NGC 1032. The lack of any trace of recent star formation near the SN location, and the very low ejected mass we find (\~{}0.3 M{\_}Sun) argues strongly against a core-collapse origin of this event. Our spectroscopic observations and the derived nucleosynthetic output show that the SN ejecta is dominated by helium-burning products, indicating that SN 2005E was neither a subluminous nor a regular SNe Ia. We have therefore found a new type of stellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system. The SN ejecta contain 5-10 times more calcium than observed in any known type of SNe, and likely additional large amounts of radioactive 44Ti. Such SNe may thus help resolve fundamental physical puzzles, extending from the composition of the primitive solar system and that of the oldest stars, to the Galactic production of positrons.},

After reviewing the energy variational method and describing the approach, several equivalent stability conditions are established and secular vs. dynamical instabilities are discussed. Then, the equilibrium structure equations are derived for isolated, rotating polytropes, and axisymmetric configurations (compressible Maclaurin spheroids) are considered. Particular attention is given to triaxial configurations, either in a state of uniform rotation (generalizing the classical Jacobi ellipsoids) or with internal fluid motions of uniform vorticity (the compressible analogues of Riemann-S ellipsoids) and to the stability of these single star configurations. The compressible generalizations of the Roche and Roche-Riemann problems for a polytrope in orbit about a point-mass companion are solved, and the generalized Darwin problem for two identical polytropes in a binary is considered.},

We establish the validity of our approximations and demonstrate the simplicity and power of the method by rederiving a number of known results concerning the stability and dynamical oscillations of rapidly rotating polytropes. In particular, we present a generalization to compressible fluids of Chandrasekhar's classical results for the secular and dynamical instabilities of incompressible Maclaurin spheroids. We also present several applications of our method to astrophysical problems of great current interest, such as the tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole, the coalescence of compact binaries driven by the emission of gravitational waves, and the development of instabilities in close binary systems.},

	N2 = {We study the importance of hydrodynamic effects on the evolution of coalescing binary neutron stars. Using an approximate energy functional constructed from equilibrium solutions for polytropic binary configuration, we incorporate hydrodynamic effects into the calculation of the orbital decay driven by gravitational wave emission. In particular, we follow the transition between the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation and the rapid dynamical evolution of confirgurations approaching contact. We show that a purely Newtonian hydrodynamic instability can significantly accelerate the coalescence at small separation. Such an instability occurs in all close binary configurations containing sufficiently incompressible stars. Calculations are performed for various neutron star masses, radii, and spins. The influence of the stiffness of the equation of state is also explored by varying the effective polytopic index. Typically, we find that the radial infall velocity just prior to contact is about 10{\%} of the tangential orbital velocity. Once the stability limit is reached, the final evolution only takes another orbit. Post-Newtonian effects can move the stability limit to a larger binary separation, and may induce an even larger radial velocity. We also consider the possibiltiy of mass transfer form one neutron star to the other. We show that stable mass transfer is unlikely except when the mass of one of the components is very small (M is less than or approximately 0.4 solar mass) and the viscosity is high enough to maintain corotation. Otherwise, either the two stars come into contact or the dynamical instability sets in before a Roche limit can be reached.},

Our method is based on the use of ellipsoidal trial functions in an energy variational principle. We consider both synchronized and nonsynchronized systems, constructing the compressible generalizations of the classical Darwin and Darwin-Riemann configurations. Our method can be applied to a wide variety of binary models where the stellar masses, radii, spins, entropies, and polytropic indices are all allowed to vary over wide ranges and independently for each component. We find that both secular and dynamical instabilities can develop before a Roche limit or contact is reached along a sequence of models with decreasing binary separation. High incompressibility always makes a given binary system more susceptible to these instabilities, but the dependence on the mass ratio is more complicated. As simple applications, we construct models of double degenerate systems and of low-mass main-sequence star binaries. We also discuss the orbital evoltuion of close binary systems under the combined influence of fluid viscosity and secular angular momentum losses from processes like gravitational radiation. We show that the existence of global fluid instabilities can have a profound effect on the terminal evolution of coalescing binaries. The validity of our analytic solutions is examined by means of detailed comparisons with the results of recent numerical fluid calculations in three dimensions.},

We follow in detail the initial phase of the merging for several masses of the primary and the secondary of the binary system. Special attention has been paid to the issue of whether or not thermonuclear runaway occurs during the process of merging. We find that although relatively high temperatures are attained during the most violent phase of the merging process, the thermonuclear flash is rapidly quenched. The total mass lost by the system is also relatively small (of the order of 0.5{\%} at most) except for the most massive primaries for which it is still small (˜2.2{\%}). Consequently, a heavy accretion disk around the primary is formed. We also discuss the subsequent evolution of the resulting system and the possible astrophysical scenarios of interest.

Studies of the presupernova evolution suggest asymmetric, off-center ignition, and here we explore its consequences in two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) simulations. Compared with centrally ignited models, one-sided ignitions initially burn less and release less energy. For the distributions of ignition points studied, ignition within two hemispheres typically leads to the unbinding of the white dwarf, while ignition within a small fraction of one hemisphere does not. We also examine the spreading of the blast over the surface of the white dwarf that occurs as the first plumes of burning erupt from the star. In particular, our studies test whether the collision of strong compressional waves can trigger a detonation on the far side of the star as has been suggested by Plewa and coworkers. The maximum temperature reached in these collisions is sensitive to how much burning and expansion has already gone on, and to the dimensionality of the calculation. Although detonations are sometimes observed in 2D models, none ever happens in the corresponding 3D calculations. Collisions between the expansion fronts of multiple bubbles also seem, in the usual case, unable to ignite a detonation. ``Gravitationally confined detonation'' is therefore not a robust mechanism for the explosion. Detonation may still be possible in these models, however, either following a pulsation or by spontaneous detonation if the turbulent energy is high enough.},

This concept and semianalytical methods are used to demonstrate that material escapes from the surface of the contact component in a highly anisotropic stellar wind, that the wind throttles into a narrow stream of material whose width is a function of the orbital separation and whose density is a function of the mass transfer rate and the relative orbital speed of the two stars, and that the stream results in the formation of a disk of material of prescribed size orbiting the detached component if the latter is smaller than a specified size.},

Allowance is made for the finite growth time of the instability. The results are applied to the formation of single millisecond pulsars in the galactic disk and it is found that mass transfer from a white dwarf onto a neutron star is dynamically unstable for white dwarf masses greater than about 0.5 solar masses. This lower limit for unstable mass transfer is somewhat larger than that found previously. A further application is the formation of long period and ultrashort-period white-dwarf/neutron-star binaries, via mass transfer from a giant to a neutron star. It is found that incipient mass transfer from an approximately 0.8-solar mass giant to an approximately 1.2-solar mass neutron star occurs on a sufficiently slow time scale for an accretion disk to form.},

We show that in the first model possibly no accretion disk forms at the onset of the mass transfer. The stability and the rate of mass transfer then depend on the tidal coupling between the accretor and the orbital motion. In the second model the formation of AM CVn stars may be prevented by detonation of the CO white dwarf accretor and the disruption of the system. With the most favourable conditions for the formation of AM CVn stars we find a current Galactic birth rate of 6.8 10-3 yr-1. Unfavourable conditions give 1.1 10-3 yr-1. The expected total number of the systems in the Galaxy is 9.4 107 and 1.6 107, respectively. We model very simple selection effects to get some idea about the currently expected observable population and discuss the (quite good) agreement with the observed systems.},

Accretion is treated in two extremes where stream effects are neglected or included spherically symmetrically in the surface boundary conditions of the accreting component. The onset and initial stages of mass transfer are described, the development of mass loss on a dynamic time scale is followed, and the manifestation of a Bath-type instability in the mass-loss rate is examined. The detailed behavior of the primary's interior during this instability is analyzed, and the evolution of the accreting secondary is traced with and without the inclusion of stream effects. The model system is discussed in terms of the origin of W UMa systems. It is concluded that most W UMa systems have always existed in the contact state and that the behavior of the model supports the theory of a fission origin for close binaries.},

	N2 = {Type Ia supernovae result when carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binary systems accrete mass from companion stars, reach a critical mass and explode. The near uniformity of their light curves makes these supernovae good `standard candles' for measuring cosmic expansion, but a correction must be applied to account for the fact that the brighter ones have broader light curves. One-dimensional modelling, with a certain choice of parameters, can reproduce this general trend in the width-luminosity relation; but the processes of ignition and detonation have recently been shown to be intrinsically asymmetric, so parameterization must have its limits. Here we report multi-dimensional modelling of the explosion physics and radiative transfer, which reveals that the breaking of spherical symmetry is a critical factor in determining both the width-luminosity relation and the observed scatter about it. The deviation from spherical symmetry can also explain the finite polarization detected in the light from some supernovae. The slope and normalization of the width-luminosity relation has a weak dependence on certain properties of the white dwarf progenitor, in particular the trace abundances of elements other than carbon and oxygen. Failing to correct for this effect could lead to systematic overestimates of up to 2 per cent in the distance to remote supernovae.},

While falling toward the black hole, the star is not only stretched along the orbital direction but also even more severely compressed at right angles to the orbit. The overbearing degree of compression achieved shortly after pericenter leads to the production of strong shocks that largely homogenize the temperature profile of the star, resulting in surface temperatures comparable to the initial temperature of the star's core. This phenomenon, which precedes the fallback accretion phase, gives rise to a unique double-peaked X-ray signature that, if detected, may be one of the few observable diagnostics of how stars behave under the influence of strong gravitational fields. If \~{}106 M sun black holes were prevalent in small or even dwarf galaxies, the nearest of such flares may be detectable by EXIST from no further away than the Virgo Cluster.},

The theory is based on two major assumptions: (1) detonation is triggered via the Zeldovich gradient mechanism inside a region of mixed fuel and products, and (2) the mixed region is produced by a turbulent mixing of fuel and products either inside an active deflagration front or during the global expansion and subsequent contraction of an exploding white dwarf. We determine the critical size of the mixed region required to initiate a detonation in a degenerate carbon-oxygen mixture. This critical length is much larger than the width of the reaction front of a Chapman-Jouguet detonation. However, at densities greater than \~{}=5 x 106 g cm-3, it is much smaller than the size of a white dwarf. We derive the critical turbulent intensity required to create the mixed region inside an active deflagration front in which a detonation can form. We conclude that the density rho tr at which a detonation can form in a carbon-oxygen white dwarf is low, less than 2--5 x 107 g cm-3 but greater than 5 x 106 g cm-3.},

It has been suggested that this hypercritical mode of accretion leads inevitably to the formation of stellar mass black holes, with implications both for some gamma ray burst models and for the predicted event rate in future Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) observations. We study the hydrodynamics of this flow at large radii (R>>Rns), and show that for low Mach number flows, in two dimensions, modest density gradients in the stellar envelope suffice to produce a hot, advection-dominated accretion disk around the accreting object. The fate of the neutron star depends critically on the highly uncertain nature and strength of outflows generated by such a disk. We argue that strong outflows are likely, in which case insufficient accretion occurs to force collapse to a black hole before the envelope has been ejected.},

The energy generation rate of these two small networks are also compared to the energy generation rate given by a 489 isotope reaction network with weak reactions turned on and off. The comparison between the seven isotope and α-chain reaction networks indicate the extent to which one can be replaced by the other, and the comparison with the 489 isotope reaction network roughly indicates under what physical conditions it is safe to use the seven isotope and α-chain reaction networks. The seven isotope reaction network reproduces the nuclear energy generation rate of the standard α-chain reaction network to within 30{\%}, but often much better, during hydrostatic and explosive helium, carbon, and oxygen burning. It will also provide energy generation rates within 30{\%} of an α-chain reaction network for silicon burning at densities less than 107 g cm-3. Provided there remains an equal number of protons and neutrons (Ye=0.5) over the course of the evolution, and that flows through α-particle channels dominate, then both of the small reaction networks return energy generation rates that are compatible with the energy generation rate returned by the 489 reaction network. If Ye is significantly different from 0.5, or if there are substantial flows through neutron and protons channels, then it is not generally safe to employ any α-chain based reaction network. The relative accuracy of the seven isotope reaction network, combined with its reduction in the computational cost, suggest that it is a suitable replacement for α-chain reaction networks for parameter space surveys of a wide class of multidimensional stellar models.},

	N2 = {Methods for solving the stiff system of ordinary differential equations that constitute nuclear reaction networks are surveyed. Three semi-implicit time integration algorithms are examined; a traditional first-order-accurate Euler method, a fourth-order-accurate Kaps-Rentrop method, and a variable-order Bader-Deuflhard method. These three integration methods are coupled to eight different linear algebra packages. Four of the linear algebra packages operate on dense matrices (LAPACK, LUDCMP, LEQS, GIFT), three of them are designed for the direct solution of sparse matrices (MA28, UMFPACK, Y12M), and one uses an iterative method for sparse matrices (BiCG). The scaling properties and behavior of the 24 combinations (3 time integration methods times 8 linear algebra packages) are analyzed by running each combination on seven different nuclear reaction networks. These reaction networks range from a hardwired 13 isotope α-chain and heavy-ion reaction network, which is suitable for most multidimensional simulations of stellar phenomena, to a 489 isotope reaction network, which is suitable for determining the yields of isotopes lighter than technetium in spherically symmetric models of Type II supernovae. Each of the time integration methods and linear algebra packages are capable of generating accurate results, but the efficiency of the various methods-evaluated across several different machine architectures and compiler options-differ dramatically. If the execution speed of reaction networks that contain less than about 50 isotopes is an overriding concern, then the variable-order Bader-Deuflhard time integration method coupled with routines generated from the GIFT matrix package or LAPACK with vendor-optimized BLAS routines is a good choice. If the amount of storage needed for any reaction network is a concern, then any of the sparse matrix packages will reduce the storage costs by 70{\%}-90{\%}. When a balance between accuracy, overall efficiency, and ease of use is desirable, then the variable-order Bader-Deuflhard time integration method coupled with the MA28 sparse matrix package is a strong choice.},

It is argued that single-degenerate models, in which the white dwarf accretes from a subgiant or giant companion are currently favored.

Special attention is given to the fate of white dwarfs of all masses that approach the black hole close enough to be disrupted and severely compressed to such an extent that explosive nuclear burning can be triggered. Consistent modeling of the gas dynamics together with the nuclear reactions allows for a realistic determination of the explosive energy release. In the most favorable cases, the nuclear energy release may be comparable to that of typical Type Ia supernovae. Although the explosion will increase the mass fraction escaping on hyperbolic orbits, a good fraction of the debris remains to be swallowed by the hole, causing a bright soft X-ray flare lasting for about a year. Such transient signatures, if detected, would be a compelling testimony for the presence of a moderately massive black hole (below 105 M sun).},

In this scenario, a shock-triggered thermonuclear explosion ensues from the collision of two WDs. Consistent modeling of the gas dynamics together with nuclear reactions using both a smoothed particle and a grid-based hydrodynamics code are performed to study the viability of this alternative progenitor channel. We find that shock-triggered ignition and the synthesis of Ni are in fact a natural outcome for moderately massive WD pairs colliding close to head-on. We use a multi-dimensional radiative transfer code to calculate the emergent broadband light curves and spectral time series of these events. The synthetic spectra and light curves compare well to those of normal Type Ia supernovae over a similar B-band decline rate and are broadly consistent with the Phillips relation, although a mild dependence on viewing angle is observed due to the asymmetry of the ejected debris. While event rates within galactic centers and globular clusters are found to be much too low to explain the bulk of the Type Ia supernovae population, they may be frequent enough to make as much as a one percent contribution to the overall rate. Although these rate estimates are still subject to substantial uncertainties, they do suggest that dense stellar systems should provide upcoming supernova surveys with hundreds of such collision-induced thermonuclear explosions per year.},

Recently, there has been some discussion about the dynamics of these last stages, different methods seemed to provide qualitatively different results. While earlier SPH simulations indicated a very quick disruption of the binary on roughly the orbital time scale, more recent grid-based calculations find long-lived mass transfer for many orbital periods. Here we demonstrate how sensitive the dynamics of this last stage is to the exact initial conditions. We show that, after a careful preparation of the initial conditions, the reportedly short-lived systems undergo mass transfer for many dozens of orbits. The reported numbers of orbits are resolution-biased and therefore represent only lower limits to what is realized in nature. Nevertheless, the study shows convincingly the convergence of different methods to very similar results.},

Some authors claim a vast population of halo white dwarfs, which would be in accordance with some investigations of the early phases of Galaxy formation claiming a top-heavy initial- mass- function. Here, I present a model of the population of white dwarfs in the Milky Way based on observations of the local white dwarf sample and a standard model of Galactic structure. This model will be used to estimate the space densities of thin disc, thick disc and halo white dwarfs and their contribution to the baryonic mass budget of the Milky Way. One result of this investigation is that white dwarfs of the halo population contribute a large fraction of the Galactic white dwarf number count, but they are not responsible for the lion's share of stellar mass in the Milky Way. Another important result is the substantial contribution of the - often neglected - population of thick disc white dwarfs. Misclassification of thick disc white dwarfs is responsible for overestimates of the halo population in previous investigations.},

The binary components are approximated as polytropes of index n=3/2, and the initially synchronously rotating, semidetached equilibrium binary is evolved hydrodynamically, with the gravitational potential being computed through the solution of Poisson's equation. Upon initiating deep contact in our baseline simulation, the mass transfer rate grows by more than an order of magnitude over approximately 10 orbits, as would be expected for dynamically unstable mass transfer. However, the mass transfer rate then reaches a peak value, the binary expands, and the mass transfer event subsides. The binary must therefore have crossed the critical mass ratio for stability against dynamical mass transfer. Despite the initial loss of orbital angular momentum into the spin of the accreting star, we find that the accretor's spin saturates and that angular momentum is returned to the orbit more efficiently than has been previously suspected for binaries in the direct-impact accretion mode. To explore this surprising result, we directly measure the critical mass ratio for stability by imposing artificial angular momentum loss at various rates to drive the binary to an equilibrium mass transfer rate. For one of these driven evolutions, we attain equilibrium mass transfer and deduce that, effectively, qcrit has evolved to approximately 2/3. Despite the absence of a fully developed disk, tidal interactions appear to be effective in returning excess spin angular momentum to the orbit.},

Spectra of this quality can be used to constrain the temperature, luminosity, and general wind properties of OB stars, when used in conjunction with sophisticated atmospheric model codes. Most important is the need for moderately high resolutions (R>=5000) and very high signal-to-noise (S/N>=150) spectra for a meaningful profile analysis. When using near-infrared spectra for a classification system, moderately high signal-to-noise (S/N\~{}100) is still required, though the resolution can be relaxed to just a thousand or two. In the Appendix we provide a set of very high-quality near-infrared spectra of Brackett lines in six early-A dwarfs.

	N2 = {We present 2 μm (K band) spectra of 180 well-studied, optically visible, luminous stars. Most of the stars are of OB spectral type, but we have also included a number of Oe and Be stars, OBN and OBC stars, cool hypergiant stars, and high-mass X-ray binary stars. Our aim in studying normal OB stars is to develop an empirical relationship between 2 μm spectral features of these massive stars and their stellar temperature and luminosity. We find the system of lines between 2.0 and 2.2 μm is particularly good for differentiating the early- and mid-O type stars. In the late-O and early-B stars, differentiation becomes more difficult, as the features show only moderate changes. We have developed a spectral classification system for the K band to be used to estimate effective temperatures of 0 and early-B stars. We demonstrate that K-band spectroscopy is superior in estimating the temperature of hot, luminous stars than the traditional methods of using infrared or even optical photometric colors alone. The only requirements are that adequate resolution (R > 1000) and signal-to-noise (S/N ˜70) be achieved. With our classification system, stars behind large amounts of visible extinction, such as in young, heavily reddened H II regions throughout our Galaxy, may be identified and studied for the first time through 2 μm spectroscopy. Emission lines are commonly seen in the K-band spectra of supergiant stars, however, the OBN super-giants, which have a higher ratio of some processed materials at their surface, may be more likely to show line emission, especially the He I singlet transition at 2.058 μm. This has led us to propose an evolutionary scenario for some of the Galactic center He I emission-line stars, which evokes rotational mixing (Maeder 1987; Langer 1992) to explain both the strong line emission and high luminosity of these mysterious sources. We have compared our spectroscopic database with the most recent stellar atmosphere models. We are encouraged by the good match between the model line profiles at 2 μm of Schaerer et al. (1996b) and those observed in OB stars. Finally, we include a thorough discussion of the observational and reduction methods employed to obtain the spectra shown in this atlas for the benefit of those wishing to obtain similar, classification-quality, near-infrared spectra.},

The first model predicts modest eccentricities, lower than those observed in the S-star cluster, while the second model predicts higher eccentricities than observed. The Newtonian N-body simulations include a dense cluster of 10 M sun stellar-mass black holes (SBHs), expected to accumulate near the MBH by mass segregation. Perturbations from the SBHs tend to randomize the stellar orbits, partially erasing the dynamical signatures of their origin. The eccentricities of the initially highly eccentric stars evolve, in 20 Myr (the S-star lifespan), to a distribution that is consistent with the observed eccentricity distribution. In contrast, the eccentricities of the initially more circular orbits fail to evolve to the observed values in 20 Myr, arguing against the disk migration scenario. We find that 20{\%}-30{\%} of the S-stars are tidally disrupted by the MBH over their lifetimes, and that the S-stars are not likely to be ejected as hypervelocity stars outside the central 0.05 pc by close encounters with SBHs.},

N-body simulations have also shown that for certain initial conditions runaway merging of stars happens in dense star clusters, which could lead to the formation of IMBHs. In the present paper we have performed N-body simulations of young clusters such as MGG-11 of M82 in which IMBHs form through runaway merging. We took into account the effect of tidal energy dissipation of stars passing close to the IMBH to study the tidal capture and disruption of stars by IMBHs. In our simulations, IMBHs have a high chance of capturing stars through tidal energy dissipation within a few core relaxation times. For \~{}30 per cent of our runs a ULX is formed through tidal capture within 7-12Myr, consistent with the age limits of MGG-11. Our results strengthen the case for some ULX being powered by IMBHs.},

This is important for GW detection, e.g., by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Signal identification requires knowledge of the waveforms, which depend on the orbital parameters. We use analytical and Monte Carlo methods to analyze the interplay between GW dissipation and scattering in the presence of a mass sink during the transition from the initial scattering-dominated phase to the final dissipation-dominated phase of the inspiral. Our main results are as follows. (1) Stars typically enter the GW-emitting phase with high eccentricities. (2) The GW event rate per galaxy is afew×10-9 yr-1 for typical central stellar cusps, almost independently of the relaxation time or the MBH mass. (3) For intermediate-mass black holes of \~{}103 Msolar such as may exist in dense stellar clusters, the orbits are very eccentric and the inspiral is rapid, so the sources are very short-lived.},

	N2 = {We present an extensive study of accretion onto neutron stars in which the velocity of the neutron star and structure of the surrounding medium is such that the Bondi-Royle accretion exceeds 10-4 Msun yr-1. Two types of initial conditions are considered for a range of entropies and chemical compositions: an atmosphere in pressure equilibrium above the neutron star, and a freely falling inflow of matter from infinity (also parameterized by the infall rate). We then evolve the system with one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamic codes to determine the outcome. For most cases, hypercritical (also termed "super Eddington") accretion caused by rapid neutrino cooling allows the neutron star to accrete above the Bondi-Hoyle rate as previously pointed out by Chevalier. However, for a subset of simulations which corresponds to evolutionarily common events, convection driven by neutrino heating can lead to explosions by a mechanism similar to that found in core-collapse supernovae. Armed with the results from our calculations, we are in a position to predict the fate of a range of rapid-infall neutron star accretors present in certain low-mass X-ray binaries, common envelope systems, supernova fallbacks, and Thorne-Zytkow objects (TZOs). A majority of the common envelope systems that we considered led to explosions expelling the envelope, halting the neutron star's inward spiral, and allowing the formation of close binary systems. As a result, the smothered neutron stars produced in the collisions studied by Davies \& Benz may also explode, probably preventing them from forming millisecond pulsars. For the most massive supernovae, in which the fallback of material toward the neutron star after a successful explosion is large, we find that a black hole is formed in a few seconds. Finally, we argue that the current set of TZO formation scenarios is inadequate and leads instead to hypercritical accretion and black hole formation. Moreover, it appears that many of the current TZ models have structures ill suited for modeling by mixing-length convection. This has prompted us to develop a simple test to determine the viability of this approximation for a variety of convective systems.},

SN 2008ha had a very low peak luminosity, reaching only MV = -14.2 mag, and low line velocities of only \~{}2000 km s-1 near maximum brightness, indicating a very small kinetic energy per unit mass of ejecta. Spectroscopically, SN 2008ha is a member of the SN 2002cx-like class of SNe, a peculiar subclass of SNe Ia however, SN 2008ha is the most extreme member, being significantly fainter and having lower line velocities than the typical member, which is already \~{}2 mag fainter and has line velocities \~{}5000 km s-1 smaller (near maximum brightness) than a normal SN Ia. SN 2008ha had a remarkably short rise time of only \~{}10 days, significantly shorter than either SN 2002cx-like objects (\~{}15 days) or normal SNe Ia (\~{}19.5 days). The bolometric light curve of SN 2008ha indicates that SN 2008ha peaked at L peak = (9.5 $\pm$1.4) ×1040 erg s-1, making SN 2008ha perhaps the least luminous SN ever observed. From its peak luminosity and rise time, we infer that SN 2008ha generated (3.0 $\pm$0.9) ×10-3 M sun of 56Ni, had a kinetic energy of \~{}2 ×1048 erg, and ejected 0.15 M sun of material. The host galaxy of SN 2008ha has a luminosity, star formation rate, and metallicity similar to those of the Large magellanic Cloud. We classify three new (and one potential) members of the SN 2002cx-like class, expanding the sample to 14 (and one potential) members. The host-galaxy morphology distribution of the class is consistent with that of SNe Ia, Ib, Ic, and II. Several models for generating low-luminosity SNe can explain the observations of SN 2008ha however, if a single model is to describe all SN 2002cx-like objects, deflagration of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, with SN 2008ha being a partial deflagration and not unbinding the progenitor star, is preferred. The rate of SN 2008ha-like events is \~{}10{\%} of the SN Ia rate, and in the upcoming era of transient surveys, several thousand similar objects may be discovered, suggesting that SN 2008ha may be the tip of a low-luminosity transient iceberg.},

In this work, we critically examine recent claims that these methods violate Galilean invariance of the Euler equations. We demonstrate that Eulerian hydrodynamics methods do converge to a Galilean-invariant solution, provided a well-defined convergent solution exists. Specifically, we show that numerical diffusion, resulting from diffusion-like terms in the discretized hydrodynamical equations solved by Eulerian methods, accounts for the effects previously identified as evidence for the Galilean non-invariance of these methods. These velocity-dependent diffusive terms lead to different results for different bulk velocities when the spatial resolution of the simulation is kept fixed, but their effect becomes negligible as the resolution of the simulation is increased to obtain a converged solution. In particular, we find that Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities develop properly in realistic Eulerian calculations regardless of the bulk velocity provided the problem is simulated with sufficient resolution (a factor of 2-4 increase compared to the case without bulk flows for realistic velocities). Our results reiterate that high-resolution Eulerian methods can perform well and obtain a convergent solution, even in the presence of highly supersonic bulk flows.},

The impacting body or bodies must be large - larger than the Moon and perhaps even larger than Mars. This definition does not assume that the formation of the Moon was necessarily a singular event. Among proponents of the collision hypothesis, there are those who think that a single event overwhelmingly dominated and those who think that a few (or even many) impact events were needed. There are even versions of the collision hypothesis that are not very different from extreme versions of one of the alternative origin scenarios of capture, fission, and binary accretion! This review proceeds by advancing 10 propositions that the author believes embody the most important issues confronting the theory. These propositions may or may not be true, but they form a framework for asking the right questions.},

The non--convexity causes non--standardwave patterns, e.g. composite waves and anomalous behavior of physical quantitiesalong classical waves, e.g. expansion and sonic shocks, may occur. In contrast tostandard Riemann solvers, these effects are taken into special account. The derivationof the algorithm is based on construction principles which are motivated byanalytical investigations in the context of gas dynamics as well as general systemsof hyperbolic conservation laws.With the aid of the extended Riemann solver we compare an ideal gas and areal gas. The results show that the non--classical effects are significant and can notbe treated as a perturbation of an ideal gas. This implies that existing flow solvershave to be appropriately adapted when performing numerical simulations of flows influids exhibiting non--classical effects such as retrograde flui...},

	N2 = {Prior models of lunar-forming impacts assume that both the impactor and the target protoearth were not rotating prior to the Moon-forming event. However, planet formation models suggest that such objects would have been rotating rapidly during the late stages of terrestrial accretion. In this paper I explore the effects of pre-impact rotation on impact outcomes through more than 100 hydrodynamical simulations that consider a range of impactor masses, impact angles and impact speeds. Pre-impact rotation, particularly in the target protoearth, can substantially alter collisional outcomes and leads to a more diverse set of final planet disk systems than seen previously. However, the subset of these impacts that are also lunar-forming candidates---i.e. that produce a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk---have properties similar to those determined for collisions of non-rotating objects {$[$}Canup, R.M., Asphaug, E., 2001. Nature 412, 708 712; Canup, R.M., 2004a. Icarus 168, 433 456{$]$}. With or without pre-impact rotation, a lunar-forming impact requires an impact angle near 45 degrees, together with a low impact velocity that is not more than 10{\%} larger than the Earth's escape velocity, and produces a disk containing up to about two lunar masses that is composed predominantly of material originating from the impactor. The most significant differences in the successful cases involving pre-impact spin occur for impacts into a retrograde rotating protoearth, which allow for larger impactors (containing up to 20{\%} of Earth's mass) and provide an improved match with the current Earth Moon system angular momentum compared to prior results. The most difficult state to reconcile with the Moon is that of a rapidly spinning, low-obliquity protoearth before the giant impact, as these cases produce disks that are not massive enough to yield the Moon.},

The spatial resolution for the impact-generated disk is greatly improved from previous particle-based simulations. This allows us to explore the fine structures of a circumterrestrial debris disk and its long-term evolution. We find that in order to form a debris disk from which a lunar-sized satellite can be accumulated, the impact must result in a disk of mostly liquid or solid debris, where pressure is not effective, well before the accumulation process starts. If the debris is dominated by vapor gas, strong spiral shocks are generated, and therefore the circumterrestrial disk cannot survive more than several days. This suggests that there could be an appropriate mass range for terrestrial planets to harbor a large moon as a result of giant impacts, since vaporization during an impact depends on the impact energy.},

Among the differentiated achondrites, three isotopic groups are recognized: (1) SNC (Mars), (2) Earth and Moon, and (3) HED (howardites, eucrites, diogenites). The HED group also contains the mesosiderites, main-group pallasites, and silicates from IIIAB irons. The angrites may be marginally resolvable from the HED group. Within each of these groups, internal geologic processes give rise to isotopic variations along a slope- fractionation line, as is well known for terrestrial materials. Variations of 17 O from one planet to another are inherited from the inhomogeneities in the solar nebula, as illustrated by the isotopic compositions of chondrites and their constituents. Among the undifferentiated achondrites, five isotopic groups are found: (1) aubrites, (2) winonaites and IAB-IIICD irons, (3) brachinites, (4) acapulcoites and lodranites, and (5) ureilites. The isotopic compositions of aubrites coincide with the Earth and Moon, and also with the enstatite chondrites. These bodies apparently were derived from a common reservoir, the isotopic composition of which was established at the chondrule scale by nebular processes. Isotopic similarities between chondrites and achondrites are seen only for the following instances: (1) enstatite chondrites and aubrites, (2) H chondrites and IIE irons, and (3) L or LL chondrites and IV A irons. The isotopic data also support the following genetic associations: (1) winonaites and IAB-IIICD irons, (2) acapulcoites and lodranites, and (3) ureilites and dark inclusions of C3 chondrites. An attempt to reconcile the whole-planet isotopic compositions of Earth, Mars, and the eucrite parent body with mixing models of their chemical compositions failed. It is not possible to satisfy both the chemical and isotopic compositions of the terrestrial planets using known primitive Solar System components.},

	N2 = {It is well established that the prolonged and thorough mixing of numerous nucleosynthetic components that constitutes the matter in the solar nebula resulted in an essential isotopic homogeneity of the solar system material. This may or may not be true for the short-lived radionuclides which were injected into or formed within the solar nebula just prior to or during solar system formation. Distinguishing between their heterogeneous or homogeneous distribution is important because the short- lived radionuclides are now widely used for the relative chronology of various objects and processes in the early solar system and as constraints for models of nucleosynthesis. The recent studies of the 53Mn-53Cr isotope system (half life of 53Mn is 3.7 Ma) in various solar system objects have shown that the relative abundance of radiogenic 53Cr is consistent with essentially homogeneous distribution of 53Mn in the asteroid belt. Thus, the relative 53Mn-53Cr chronometer can be directly used for dating samples which originated in the asteroid belt. Importantly, however, all meteorite groups studied so far indicate a clear excess of 53Cr as compared to Earth and to a lunar sample, which exhibits also a terrestrial 53Cr/52Cr ratio. The results from the Martian (SNC) meteorites show that their 53Cr excesses are less than half of those found in the asteroid belt bodies. Thus, the characteristic 53Cr/52Cr ratio of Mars is intermediate between that of the Earth-Moon system and those of the other meteorites. If these 53Cr variations are viewed as a function of the heliocentric distance, the radial dependence of the relative abundances of radiogenic 53Cr is indicated. This observed gradient can be explained by either an early, volatility controlled, Mn/Cr fractionation within the nebula or by an initial radial heterogeneous distribution of 53Mn. Although model calculations of the Mn/Cr ratios in the bulk terrestrial planets seem to be inconsistent with the volatility driven scenario, the precision of these calculations is inadequate for eliminating this possibility. In contrast, recent studies of the 53Mn-53Cr system in the enstatite chondrites indicate that, while their bulk Mn/Cr ratios are essentially the same as in ordinary chondrites, the 53Cr excess in bulk enstatite chondrites is three times lower than that in the bulk ordinary chondrites. This difference cannot be explained by a Mn/Cr fractionation and, thus, strongly suggests that a radial heterogeneous distribution of 53Mn must have existed in at least the early inner solar system. Using the observed gradient and the 53Cr/52Cr ratio of the bulk enstatite chondrites, their parent body(ies) formed at ˜1.4 AU or somewhat closer to the Sun.},

	N2 = {We report high precision ($\pm$0.5{\%}o) potassium isotopic determinations on bulk chondrites, achondrites, and lunar samples, on a separated chondrule, and two CAls. We find that potassium shows a remarkable isotopic homogeneity in various solar system bodies, even though there are chemical depletions of a factor of about 30, between C1 chondrites and eucrites and lunar samples. Theories that propose the evaporation of volatile elements from initially condensed (C1 chondrite) material to account for such chemical depletions, necessarily imply the existence of large isotopic mass fractionations, e.g., about +40{\%}o for Earth, +90{\%}o for eucrites and lunar rocks. Volatile loss of potassium (and by implication Na, Rb, Cs, and other elements of similar volatility) during chondrule formation is also ruled out. The high precision of the data place stringent limits of 52{\%} on the quantity of potassium that could have been lost by partial volatilization. This is not detectable by standard chemical techniques, which can resolve 5-20{\%} changes in the K/La and K/U ratios. The two-component models proposed by Larimer and Anders (1967) and by W{\"a}nke et al. (1984) invoke vaporization of alkalis which is not supported by the potassium isotope results. The chemical depletion of alkalis and other volatiles must have preceded the processes of chondrule, chondrite, and planetary formation, and occurred during the condensation of precursor dust, probably from a hot stage in the solar nebula.},

The earth model assumes that the protoearth accreted from a material resembling a high-temperature condensate from the solar nebula.

For dynamically unstable systems where the accretion stream directly impacts the surface of the primary, the final tens of orbits can have mass accretion rates that range from 10--5 to 10--3 M sun s--1, leading to the rapid accumulation of helium on the surface of the primary. After \~{}10--2 M sun of helium has been accreted, the ram pressure of the hot helium torus can deflect the accretion stream such that the stream no longer directly impacts the surface. The velocity difference between the stream and the torus produces shearing which seeds large-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities along the interface between the two regions. These instabilities eventually grow into dense knots of material that periodically strike the surface of the primary, adiabatically compressing the underlying helium torus. If the temperature of the compressed material is raised above a critical temperature, the timescale for triple-αreactions becomes comparable to the dynamical timescale, leading to the detonation of the primary's helium envelope. This detonation drives shock waves into the primary which tend to concentrate at one or more focal points within the primary's CO core. If a relatively small amount of mass is raised above a critical temperature and density at these focal points, the CO core may itself be detonated.},

A new equation of state is utilized that includes a treatment of molecular vapor (``M-ANEOS'' Melosh, 2000, in: Proc. Lunar Planet. Sci. Conf. 31st, p. 1903). The sensitivity of impact outcome to collision conditions is assessed, in particular how the mass, angular momentum, composition and origin (target vs. impactor) of the material placed into circumterrestrial orbit vary with impact angle, speed, impactor-to-target mass ratio, and initial thermal state of the colliding objects. The most favorable conditions for producing a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk involve collisions with an impact angle near 45 degrees and an impactor velocity at infinity <4 km/sec. For a total mass and angular momentum near to that of the current Earth-Moon system, such impacts typically place about a lunar mass of material into orbits exterior to the Roche limit, with the orbiting material composed of 10 to 30{\%} vapor by mass. In all cases, the vast majority of the orbiting material originates from the impactor, consistent with previous findings. By mapping the end fate (escaping, orbiting, or in the planet) of each particle and the peak temperature it experiences during the impact onto the figure of the initial objects, it is shown that in the successful collisions, the impactor material that ends up in orbit is primarily that portion of the object that was heated the least, having avoided direct collision with the Earth. Using these and previous results as a guide, a continuous suite of impact conditions intermediate to the ``late impact'' (Canup and Asphaug, 2001, Nature 412, 708-712) and ``early Earth'' (Cameron, 2000, in: Canup, R.M., Righter, K. (Eds.), Origin of the Earth and Moon, pp. 133-144 2001, Meteorit. Planet. Sci. 36, 9-22) scenarios is identified that should also produce iron-poor, \~{}lunar-sized satellites and a system angular momentum similar to that of the Earth-Moon system. Among these, those that leave the Earth >95{\%} accreted after the Moon-forming impact are favored here, implying a giant impactor mass between 0.11 and 0.14 Earth masses.},

These equations of motion differ only from the standard gravitational N-body problem insofar that pressure gradients and viscosity terms have to be added to the gradient of the potential to derive the forces between the particles. The numerical tools developed for "classical" N-body problems can therefore be readily applied to solve three-dimensional hydrodynamical problems.},

The impact orientation and size are constrained by the angular momentum contained in both the Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit, a quantity that has been nearly conserved over the past 4.5 billion years. Simulations of potential moon-forming impacts now achieve resolutions sufficient to study the production of bound debris. However, identifying impacts capable of yielding the Earth-Moon system has proved difficult. Previous works found that forming the Moon with an appropriate impact angular momentum required the impact to occur when the Earth was only about half formed, a more restrictive and problematic model than that originally envisaged. Here we report a class of impacts that yield an iron-poor Moon, as well as the current masses and angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. This class of impacts involves a smaller-and thus more likely-object than previously considered viable, and suggests that the Moon formed near the very end of Earth's accumulation.},

In the physically realistic case where melt ``softens'' the matrix, melt migrates along the direction parallel to the axis of minimum compressive stress and accumulates in ``veins'' (melt-rich lenses). The maximum growth rate of the instability is of order -ɛ˙0dln ɛ/df (ɛ˙0≡largest component of the principal strain tensor, ɛ=shear viscosity, f=melt fraction), and plausibility fast enough to invalidate the conventional applications of Darcy's law (e.g., mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones) since melt migrates into veins in preference to being pervasively flushed vertically. The preferred lengthscale of the instability is poorly determined but probably \~{}meters. Veins may eventually form an interconnected drainage network, allowing rapid vertical fluxing of melt.},

Situations similar to the conditions of these tests, a Sod shock, a Sedov blast, and both a static and translating King sphere, occur commonly in astrophysics, where the accurate treatment of shocks, sound waves, supernovae explosions and collapsed haloes is a key condition for obtaining reliable validated simulations. We demonstrate that comparable results can be obtained for Lagrangian and Eulerian codes by requiring that approximately one particle exists per grid cell in the region of interest. We conclude that adaptive Eulerian codes, with their ability to place refinements in regions of rapidly changing density, are well suited to problems where physical processes are related to such changes. Lagrangian methods, on the other hand, are well suited to problems where large density contrasts occur and the physics are related to the local density itself rather than the local density gradient.},

RR dominates the dynamics of compact remnants that inspiral into an MBH and emit gravitational waves (extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) events), and can either increase the EMRI rate, or strongly suppress it, depending on its still poorly determined efficiency. We use Newtonian N-body simulations to measure the RR efficiency and to explore its possible dependence on the stellar number density profile around the MBH, and the mass ratio between the MBH and a star (a single-mass stellar population is assumed). We develop an efficient and robust procedure for detecting and measuring RR in N-body simulations. We present a suite of simulations with a range of stellar density profiles and mass ratios, and measure the mean RR efficiency in the near-Keplerian limit, and explore its long-term behavior. We do not find a strong dependence on the density profile or the mass ratio. Our numerical determination of the RR efficiency in the Newtonian, single-mass population approximations, suggests that RR will likely enhance the EMRI rate by a factor of a few over the rates predicted assuming only slow stochastic two-body relaxation.},

This has decreased the metal content in the solar convection zone by almost a factor of two compared with the widely used compilation by Anders \& Grevesse (1989). While resolving a number of long-standings problems, the new 3D-based element abundances also pose serious challenges, most notably for helioseismology.},

	N2 = {We calculate the evolution of planets undergoing a strong tidal encounter using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), for a range of periastron separations. We find that outside the Roche limit, the evolution of the planet is well-described by the standard model of linear, non-radial, adiabatic oscillations. If the planet passes within the Roche limit at periastron, however, mass can be stripped from it, but in no case do we find enough energy transferred to the planet to lead to complete disruption. In light of the three new extrasolar planets discovered with periods shorter than two days, we argue that the shortest-period cases observed in the period-mass relation may be explained by a model whereby planets undergo strong tidal encounters with stars, after either being scattered by dynamical interactions into highly eccentric orbits, or tidally captured from nearly parabolic orbits. Although this scenario does provide a natural explanation for the edge found for planets at twice the Roche limit, it does not explain how such planets will survive the inevitable expansion that results from energy injection during tidal circularization.},

The dynamics of the stream can be divided into a ballistic phase, starting at the L1 point, and a hydrodynamical phase, where the stream interacts strongly with the core. Considering the merger of a 1- and 5-Msolar star with a 20-Msolar evolved supergiant, we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using the PROMETHEUS code to demonstrate how the penetration depth and post-impact conditions depend on the initial properties of the stream material (e.g. entropy, angular momentum, stream width) and the properties of the core (e.g. density structure and rotation rate). Using these results, we present a fitting formula for the entropy generated in the stream-core interaction and a recipe for the determination of the penetration depth based on a modified Bernoulli integral.},

It is estimated that 25 percent of the tidally captured binaries become mergers for a stellar system whose rms velocity is roughly 10 km/s (typical for globular clusters), while about 50 percent are expected to become mergers for rms velocity of roughly 300 km/s (typical for galactic nuclei).

Previous studies for initial conditions with two equal-mass planets revealed two discrepancies between the results of simulations and the observed orbits of exoplanets: potentially frequent collisions between giant planets and a narrow distribution of final eccentricities. We show that simulations with two unequal-mass planets starting on nearly circular orbits predict fewer collisions and a broader range of final eccentricities. Thus, the two-planet scattering model can reproduce the observed eccentricities with a plausible distribution of planet mass ratios. The model also predicts a maximum eccentricity of \~{}=0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided that both planets are initially placed on nearly circular orbits. This compares favorably with observations and will be tested by future planet discoveries. Moreover, the combination of planet-planet scattering and tidal circularization may explain the existence of some giant planets with very short period orbits. Orbital migration due to planet scattering could play an important role in explaining the distribution of orbital periods found by radial velocity surveys. We also reexamine and discuss various possible correlations between eccentricities and other properties of exoplanets. We find that radial velocity observations are consistent with planet eccentricities being correlated with the ratio of the escape velocity from the planet's surface relative to the escape velocity from the host star at the planet's location. We demonstrate that the observed distribution of planet masses, periods, and eccentricities can provide constraints for models of planet formation and evolution.},

Based on the present understanding of planet formation via core accretion and oligarchic growth, we expect that giant planets often form in closely packed configurations. While the protoplanets are embedded in a protoplanetary gas disk, dissipation can prevent eccentricity growth and suppress instabilities from becoming manifest. However, once the disk dissipates, eccentricities can grow rapidly, leading to close encounters between planets. Strong planet-planet gravitational scattering could produce both high eccentricities and, after tidal circularization, very short period planets, as observed in the exoplanet population. We present new results for this scenario based on extensive dynamical integrations of systems containing three giant planets, both with and without residual gas disks. We assign the initial planetary masses and orbits in a realistic manner following the core accretion model of planet formation. We show that, with realistic initial conditions, planet-planet scattering can reproduce quite well the observed eccentricity distribution. Our results also make testable predictions for the orbital inclinations of short-period giant planets formed via strong planet scattering followed by tidal circularization.},

	N2 = {We have investigated the formation of close-in extrasolar giant planets through a coupling effect of mutual scattering, the Kozai mechanism, and tidal circularization, by orbital integrations. Close-in gas giants would have been originally formed at several AU beyond the ice lines in protoplanetary disks and migrated close to their host stars. Although type II migration due to planet-disk interactions may be a major channel for the migration, we show that this scattering process would also give a nonnegligible contribution. We carried out orbital integrations of three planets with Jupiter mass, directly including the effect of tidal circularization. We have found that in about 30{\%} of the runs close-in planets are formed, which is much higher than suggested by previous studies. Three-planet orbit crossing usually results in the ejection of one or two planets. Tidal circularization often occurs during three-planet orbit crossing, but previous studies have monitored only the final stage after the ejection, significantly underestimating the formation probability. We have found that the Kozai mechanism in outer planets is responsible for the formation of close-in planets. During three-planet orbital crossing, Kozai excitation is repeated and the eccentricity is often increased secularly to values close enough to unity for tidal circularization to transform the inner planet to a close-in planet. Since a moderate eccentricity can retain for the close-in planet, this mechanism may account for the observed close-in planets with moderate eccentricities and without nearby secondary planets. Since these planets also remain a broad range of orbital inclinations (even retrograde ones), the contribution of this process would be clarified by more observations of Rossiter-McLaughlin effects for transiting planets.},

Our results are based on \~{}3250 numerical integrations of ensembles of randomly constructed planetary systems, each lasting 100 Myr. We find that for a remarkably wide range of initial conditions the eccentricity distributions of dynamically active planetary systems relax toward a common final equilibrium distribution, well described by the fitting formula dn\~{}eexp{$[$}-1/2(e/0.3)2{$]$}de. This distribution agrees well with the observed eccentricity distribution for e>\~{}0.2 but predicts too few planets at lower eccentricities, even when we exclude planets subject to tidal circularization. These findings suggest that a period of large-scale dynamical instability has occurred in a significant fraction of newly formed planetary systems, lasting 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than the \~{}1 Myr interval in which gas giant planets are assembled. This mechanism predicts no (or weak) correlations between semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, and mass in dynamically relaxed planetary systems. An additional observational consequence of dynamical relaxation is a significant population of planets (>\~{}10{\%}) that are highly inclined (>\~{}25$\,^{\circ}$) with respect to the initial symmetry plane of the protoplanetary disk; this population may be detectable in transiting planets through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.},

	N2 = {We present a detailed assessment of the various dynamical pathways leading to the coalescence of compact objects in globular clusters (GCs) and Short Gamma-ray Burst (SGRB) production. We consider primordial binaries, dynamically formed binaries (through tidal two-body and three-body exchange interactions), and direct impacts of compact objects (WD/NS/BH). Here, we show that if the primordial binary fraction is small, close encounters dominate the production rate of coalescing compact systems. We find that the two dominant channels are the interaction of field neutron stars (NSs) with dynamically formed binaries and two-body encounters. Under such conditions, we estimate the redshift distribution and host galaxy demographics of SGRB progenitors, and find that GCs can provide a significant contribution to the overall observed rate. Regarding the newly identified channel of close stellar encounters involving WD/NS/BH, we have carried out precise modeling of the hydrodynamical evolution, giving us a detailed description of the resulting merged system. Our calculations show that there is in principle no problem in accounting for the global energy budget of a typical SGRB. The particulars of each encounter, however, are variable in several aspects and can lead to interesting diversity. First and most importantly, the characteristics of the encounter are highly dependent on the impact parameter. This is in contrast to the merger scenario, where the masses of the compact objects dictate a typical length and luminosity scale for SGRB activity. Second, the nature of the compact star itself can produce very different outcomes. Finally, the presence of tidal tails in which material will fall back onto the central object at a later time is a robust feature of the present set of calculations. The mass involved in these structures is considerably larger than for binary mergers. It is thus possible to account generically in this scenario for a prompt episode of energy release, as well as for activity many dynamical time scales later.},

Tides raised on a planet's host star cause the planet's orbit to decay, even after the orbital eccentricity has dropped to zero. Comparison of the observed orbital distribution and predictions of tidal theory shows good qualitative agreement, suggesting tidal destruction of close-in exoplanets is common. The process can explain the observed cutoff in small semimajor axis values, the clustering of orbital periods near three days, and the relative youth of transiting planets. Contrary to previous considerations, a mechanism to stop the inward migration of close-in planets at their current orbits is not necessarily required. Planets nearing tidal destruction may be found with extremely small semimajor axes, possibly already stripped of any gaseous envelope. The recently discovered CoroT-7 b may be an example of such a planet and will probably be destroyed by tides within the next few Gyrs. Also, where one or more planets have already been accreted, a star may exhibit an unusual composition and/or spin rate.},

	N2 = {We address two outstanding issues in the sequential accretion scenario for gas giant planet formation, the retention of dust grains in the presence of gas drag and that of cores despite type I migration. The efficiency of these processes is determined by the disk structure. Theoretical models suggest that planets form in protostellar disk regions with an inactive neutral ``dead zone'' near the midplane, sandwiched together by partially ionized surface layers where magnetorotational instability is active. Due to a transition in the abundance of dust grains, the active layer's thickness decreases abruptly near the ice line. Over a range of modest accretion rates (\~{}10-9 to 10-8 Msolar yr-1), the change in the angular momentum transfer rate leads to local surface density and pressure distribution maxima near the ice line. The azimuthal velocity becomes super-Keplerian and the grains accumulate in this transition zone. This barrier locally retains protoplanetary cores and enhances the heavy-element surface density to the critical value needed to initiate efficient gas accretion. It leads to a preferred location and epoch of gas giant formation. We simulate and reproduce the observed frequency and mass-period distribution of gas giants around solar-type stars without having to greatly reduce the type I migration strength. The mass function of the short-period planets shows an enhanced population of super-Earths relative to hot Jupiters, and it can be utilized to calibrate the efficiency of type I migration and to extrapolate the fraction of stars with habitable terrestrial planets.},

According to this model, gas giants formed and acquired their mass Mp through planetesimal coagulation followed by the emergence of cores onto which gas is accreted. These protoplanets migrate and attain their asymptotic semimajor axis a through tidal interaction with their nascent disk. Based on the observed properties of protostellar disks, we generate an Mp-a distribution. Our results reproduce the observed lack of planets with intermediate mass Mp=10-100 M⊕and a<\~{}3 AU and with large mass Mp>\~{}103 M⊕and a<\~{}0.2 AU. Based on the simulated Mp-a distributions, we also evaluate the metallicity dependence of the fraction of stars harboring planets that are detectable with current radial velocity surveys. If protostellar disks attain the same fraction of heavy elements as contained in their host stars, the detection probability around metal-rich stars would be greatly enhanced because protoplanetary cores formed in them can grow to several Earth masses prior to their depletion. These large masses are required for the cores to initiate rapid gas accretion and to transform into giant planets. The theoretically extrapolated metallicity dependence is consistent with the observations. This correlation does not arise naturally in the gravitational-instability scenario. We also suggest other metallicity dependences of the planet distributions that can be tested by ongoing observations.},

On the basis of the sequential accretion hypothesis and the standard theory of gap formation and orbital migration, we show that around M dwarf stars, close-in Neptune-mass ice giant planets may be relatively common, while close-in Jupiter-mass gas giant planets are relatively rare. The mass distribution of close-in planets generally has two peaks at about Neptune mass and Jupiter mass. The lower mass peak takes the maximum frequency for M dwarfs. Around more massive solar-type stars (G dwarfs), the higher mass peak is much more pronounced. Planets around G dwarfs undergo orbital migration after fully accreting gas, while those around M dwarfs tend to migrate before starting rapid gas accretion. Close-in Neptune-mass planets may also exist around G dwarfs, although they tend to be mostly composed of silicates and iron cores and their frequency is expected to be much smaller than that of Neptune-mass planets around M dwarfs and that of gas giants around G dwarfs. We also show that the conditions for planets' migration due to their tidal interaction with the disk and the stellar mass dependence in the disk mass distribution can be calibrated by the mass distribution of short-period planets around host stars with various masses.},

	N2 = {In an attempt to develop a deterministic theory for planet formation, we examine the accretion of cores of giant planets from planetesimals, gas accretion onto the cores, and their orbital migration. We adopt a working model for nascent protostellar disks with a wide variety of surface density distributions in order to explore the range of diversity among extrasolar planetary systems. We evaluate the cores' mass growth rate Mc through runaway planetesimal accretion and oligarchic growth. The accretion rate of cores is estimated with a two-body approximation. In the inner regions of disks, the cores' eccentricity is effectively damped by their tidal interaction with the ambient disk gas and their early growth is stalled by ``isolation.'' In the outer regions, the cores' growth rate is much smaller. If some cores can acquire more mass than a critical value of several Earth masses during the persistence of the disk gas, they would be able to rapidly accrete gas and evolve into gas giant planets. The gas accretion process is initially regulated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the planets' gas envelope. Based on the assumption that the exponential decay of the disk gas mass occurs on the timescales \~{}106-107 yr and that the disk mass distribution is comparable to those inferred from the observations of circumstellar disks of T Tauri stars, we carry out simulations to predict the distributions of masses and semimajor axes of extrasolar planets. In disks as massive as the minimum-mass disk for the solar system, gas giants can form only slightly outside the ``ice boundary'' at a few AU. However, cores can rapidly grow above the critical mass inside the ice boundary in protostellar disks with 5 times more heavy elements than those of the minimum-mass disk. Thereafter, these massive cores accrete gas prior to its depletion and evolve into gas giants. The limited persistence of the disk gas and the decline in the stellar gravity prevent the formation of cores capable of efficient gas accretion outside 20-30 AU. Unimpeded dynamical accretion of gas is a runaway process that is terminated when the residual gas is depleted either globally or locally in the form of a gap in the vicinity of their orbits. Since planets' masses grow rapidly from 10 to 100 M⊕, the gas giant planets rarely form with asymptotic masses in this intermediate range. Our model predicts a paucity of extrasolar planets with mass in the range 10-100 M⊕and semimajor axis less than 3 AU. We refer to this deficit as a ``planet desert.'' We also examine the dynamical evolution of protoplanets by considering the effect of orbital migration of giant planets due to their tidal interactions with the gas disks, after they have opened up gaps in the disks. The effect of migration is to sharpen the boundaries and to enhance the contrast of the planet desert. It also clarifies the separation between the three populations of rocky, gas giant, and ice giant planets. Based on our results, we suggest that the planets' mass versus semimajor axes diagram can provide strong constraints on the dominant formation processes of planets analogous to the implications of the color-magnitude diagram on the paths of stellar evolution. We show that the mass and semimajor axis distributions generated in our simulations for the gas giants are consistent with those of the known extrasolar planets. Our results also indicate that a large fraction (90{\%}-95{\%}) of the planets that have migrated to within 0.05 AU must have perished. Future observations can determine the existence and the boundaries of the planet desert in this diagram, which can be used to extrapolate the ubiquity of rocky planets around nearby stars. Finally, the long-term dynamical interaction between planets of various masses can lead to both eccentricity excitation and scattering of planets to large semimajor axes. These effects are to be included in future models.},

	N2 = {In a further development of a deterministic planet formation model (Ida \& Lin), we consider the effect of type I migration of protoplanetary embryos due to their tidal interaction with their nascent disks. During the early phase of protostellar disks, although embryos rapidly emerge in regions interior to the ice line, uninhibited type I migration leads to their efficient self-clearing. But embryos continue to form from residual planetesimals, repeatedly migrate inward, and provide a main channel of heavy-element accretion onto their host stars. During the advanced stages of disk evolution (a few Myr), the gas surface density declines to values comparable to or smaller than that of the minimum mass nebula model, and type I migration is no longer effective for Mars-mass embryos. Over wide ranges of initial disk surface densities and type I migration efficiencies, the surviving population of embryos interior to the ice line has a total mass of several M⊕. With this reservoir, there is an adequate inventory of residual embryos to subsequently assemble into rocky planets similar to those around the Sun. However, the onset of efficient gas accretion requires the emergence and retention of cores more massive than a few M⊕prior to the severe depletion of the disk gas. The formation probability of gas giant planets and hence the predicted mass and semimajor axis distributions of extrasolar gas giants are sensitively determined by the strength of type I migration. We suggest that the distributions consistent with observations can be reproduced only if the actual type I migration timescale is at least an order of magnitude longer than that deduced from linear theories.},

In our model the star is composed of elliptical shells with different parameters and different orientations depending on time and on the radial Lagrangian coordinate of the shell. The evolution equations of this model are derived from the virial relations under certain assumptions, and the integrals of motion are identified. It is shown that the evolution equations can be deduced from a variational principle. The evolution equations are solved numerically and compared quantitatively with the results of three-dimensional numerical computations of the tidal interaction of a star with a supermassive black hole. The comparison shows very good agreement between the main ``integral'' characteristics describing the tidal interaction event in our model and in the three-dimensional computations. Our model is effectively a one-dimensional Lagrangian model from the point of view of numerical computations, and therefore it can be evolved numerically 102-103 times faster than the three-dimensional approach allows. This makes our model well suited for intensive calculations covering the whole parameter space of the problem.},

	N2 = {One of the most remarkable properties of extrasolar planets revealed by the ongoing radial velocity surveys is their high orbital eccentricities, which are difficult to explain with our current theoretical paradigm for planet formation. Observations have shown that at least \~{}20{\%} of these planets, including some with particularly high eccentricities, are orbiting a component of a wide binary star system. The presence of a distant binary companion can cause significant secular perturbations to the orbit of a planet. In particular, at high relative inclinations, a planet can undergo a large-amplitude eccentricity oscillation. This so-called Kozai mechanism is effective at a very long range, and its amplitude is purely dependent on the relative orbital inclination. In this paper, we address the following simple question: assuming that every host star with a detected giant planet also has a (possibly unseen, e.g., substellar) distant companion, with reasonable distributions of orbital parameters and masses, how well could secular perturbations reproduce the observed eccentricity distribution of planets? Our calculations show that the Kozai mechanism consistently produces an excess of planets with very high (e>\~{}0.6) and very low (e<\~{}0.1) eccentricities. Assuming an isotropic distribution of relative orbital inclination, we would expect that 23{\%} of planets do not have sufficiently high inclination angles to experience the eccentricity oscillation. By a remarkable coincidence, only 23{\%} of currently known extrasolar planets have eccentricities e<0.1. However, this paucity of near-circular orbits in the observed sample cannot be explained solely by secular perturbations. This is because, even with high enough inclinations, the Kozai mechanism often fails to produce significant eccentricity perturbations when there are other competing sources of orbital perturbations on secular timescales, such as general relativity. Our results show that, with any reasonable set of mass and initial orbital parameters, the Kozai mechanism always leaves more than 50{\%} of planets on near-circular orbits. On the other hand, the Kozai mechanism can produce many highly eccentric orbits. Indeed, the overproduction of high eccentricities observed in our models could be combined with plausible circularizing mechanisms (e.g., friction from residual gas) to create more intermediate eccentricities (e\~{}=0.1-0.6).},

For most of the stars the stellar parameters are revised versions of the ones presented in our previous work. However, we also present parameters for 18 stars with planets not previously published, and a compilation of stellar parameters for the remaining 4 planet-hosts for which we could not obtain a spectrum. A comparison of our stellar parameters with values of Teff, log g, and {$[$}Fe/H{$]$} available in the literature shows a remarkable agreement. In particular, our spectroscopic log g values are now very close to trigonometric log g estimates based on Hipparcos parallaxes. The derived {$[$}Fe/H{$]$} values are then used to confirm the previously known result that planets are more prevalent around metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we confirm that the frequency of planets is a strongly rising function of the stellar metallicity, at least for stars with {$[$}Fe/H{$]$} > 0. While only about 3{\%} of the solar metallicity stars in the CORALIE planet search sample were found to be orbited by a planet, this number increases to more than 25{\%} for stars with {$[$}Fe/H{$]$} above +0.3. Curiously, our results also suggest that these percentages might remain relatively constant for values of {$[$}Fe/H{$]$} lower than about solar, increasing then linearly with the mass fraction of heavy elements. These results are discussed in the context of the theories of planetary formation.

	N2 = {A self-consistent model for binary evolution devised by Gingold \& Monaghan (1980) is used to show that two distinctly different types of behavior are possible for close eccentric binaries. The model is based on a linear adiabatic normal mode analysis of the problem, which allows detailed examination of the transfer of energy from the orbit to the tides. We show that for most binaries, energy is exchanged quasi-periodically, with the system regulating itself so that the maximum tidal energy always remains small, and no circulation takes place. In contrast, for a range of eccentricities and periastron separations chaotic behavior prevails, with the eccentricity following a random walk and with the energy transferred to the tides during a single periastron passage being up to an order of magnitude larger than that transferred during the initial periastron passage. These results have important consequences for the study of tidal capture binaries. The standard model (McMillan, McDermott, \& Taam 1987; Ray, Kembhavi, \& Antia 1987) assumes that the energy transferred to the tides during a periastron encounter is independent of the oscillatory state of the stars, and that the amount of tidal energy present at any time can be calculated using a formula which (accurately) gives the amount deposited after the first encounter (Press \& Teukolsky 1977). The calculations presented here show that a self-consistent treatment is necessary in order to study the dynamical evolution of tidal capture binaries.},

	N2 = {We examine the long-time dynamical evolution of binaries formed by tidal capture using a self-consistent normal mode analysis. An efficient method for handling very long period orbits is developed which allows us to examine the highly eccentric phase following capture. We start with an adiabatic analysis and show that the orbital eccentricity performs a random walk between the initial eccentricity (≥1) and some nonzero minimum value. The existence of a minimum eccentricity in turn restricts the maximum tidal energy the system is capable of acquiring. We then examine dissipative systems by introducing an artificial mode damping mechanism and show that tidal capture binaries go through two distinct phases. Following capture is a short violent chaotic phase during which the dynamical behavior is as described by the adiabatic analysis. Huge tides are raised, and the tidal luminosity is likely to be large if nonlinear dissipative processes are efficient. Given that the binary survives this phase, it must dissipate a prescribed amount of energy before it enters the second phase during which the orbital behavior is no longer chaotic and the orbital eccentricity varies quasi-periodically. During this long quiescent phase, the tides are small and the binary circularizes only via dissipative processes. The prescribed energy loss and the eccentricity at the beginning of this phase depend on the periastron separation at capture. For example, for equal mass stars with an initial periastron separation of 3 stellar radii, the system starts this phase with an eccentricity of 0.8. For such a system, the quiescent circularization phase is estimated to be at least 107 yr, in contrast to a circularization time predicted by the standard model of 10 yr (McMillan, McDermott, \& Taam 1987). Since capture orbits are chaotic, there exists the possibility of a binary returning to an unbound state. We show that the majority of tidal capture binaries are stable against self-ionization. We discuss the various destructive processes which the stars must be stable against during the chaotic phase in order to enter the quiescent phase intact. We also discuss the implications for the formation of low-mass X-ray binaries and related objects and the role of tidal capture binaries in globular cluster evolution.},

	N2 = {Recent months have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of short γ-ray burst (SGRB) sources. There is now general agreement that SGRBs---or at least a substantial subset of them---are capable of producing directed outflows of relativistic matter with a kinetic luminosity exceeding by many millions that of active galactic nuclei. Given the twin requirements of energy and compactness, it is widely believed that SGRB activity is ultimately ascribable to a modest fraction of a solar mass of gas accreting on to a stellar mass black hole (BH) or to a precursor stage whose inevitable end point is a stellar mass BH. Astrophysical scenarios involving the violent birth of a rapidly rotating neutron star, or an accreting BH in a merging compact binary driven by gravitational wave emission are reviewed, along with other possible alternatives (collisions or collapse of compact objects). If a BH lies at the centre of this activity, then the fundamental pathways through which mass, angular momentum and energy can flow around and away from it play a key role in understanding how these prime movers can form collimated, relativistic outflows. Flow patterns near BHs accreting matter in the hypercritical regime, where photons are unable to provide cooling, but neutrinos do so efficiently, are discussed in detail, and we believe that they offer the best hope of understanding the central engine. On the other hand, statistical investigations of SGRB niches also furnish valuable information on their nature and evolutionary behaviour. The formation of particular kinds of progenitor sources appears to be correlated with environmental effects and cosmic epoch. In addition, there is now compelling evidence for the continuous fuelling of SGRB sources. We suggest here that the observed late flaring activity could be due to a secondary accretion episode induced by the delayed fall back of material dynamically stripped from a compact object during a merger or collision. Some important unresolved questions are identified, along with the types of observation that would discriminate among the various models. Many of the observed properties can be understood as resulting from outflows driven by hyperaccreting BHs and subsequently collimated into a pair of anti-parallel jets. It is likely that most of the radiation we receive is reprocessed by matter quite distant to the BH; SGRB jets, if powered by the hole itself, may therefore be one of the few observable consequences of how flows near nuclear density behave under the influence of strong gravitational fields.},

	N2 = {The explosion of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs via the double detonation scenario is a potential explanation for type Ia supernovae. In this scenario, a surface detonation in a helium layer initiates a detonation in the underlying carbon/oxygen core leading to an explosion. For a given core mass, a lower bound has been determined on the mass of the helium shell required for dynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite for detonation. For a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses, we investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable of triggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. We carried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two dimensions assuming rotational symmetry. The detonations are propagated using the level-set approach and a simplified scheme for nuclear reactions that has been calibrated with a large nuclear network. The same network is used to determine detailed nucleosynthetic abundances in a post-processing step. Based on approximate detonation initiation criteria in the literature, we find that secondary core detonations are triggered for all of the simulated models, ranging in core mass from 0.810 up to 1.385 M{\_}{\.o}with corresponding shell masses from 0.126 down to 0.0035 M{\_}{\.o}. This implies that, as soon as a detonation triggers in a helium shell covering a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, a subsequent core detonation is virtually inevitable.},

At a distance of only 48 pc, this would make it the closest remnant of a supernova known and imply that such systems are common in our Galaxy and others. Here we present optical spectroscopy that shows that the companion star in SDSSJ1257+5428 is in fact another white dwarf. SDSSJ1257+5428's spectrum is thus a composite, with narrow line cores from a cool, low mass white dwarf (7000 K; 0.2 Msun), and broad wings from its hotter, high-mass companion (10,000 K; > 1 Msun). We present evidence that suggests that the high-mass star is rapidly rotating with v sin i = 500 to 1000 km/s. This suggests that the most recent phase of mass transfer was long-lasting and stable as against the usually-assumed common envelope phase. Within the constraints set by our data, SDSSJ1257+5428 could have a total mass greater than the Chandrasekhar limit and thus be a potential Type Ia supernova progenitor. However, its mass ratio, q < 0.2, is extreme enough to guarantee stable mass transfer on contact, and it is probably more likely to evolve into an accreting ultracompact binary star. In the light of our model we revise the distance to SDSSJ1257+5428 to d = 100 pc.},

Moreover, this process has been proposed to explain several interesting astrophysical phenomena. Aims: We present the results of a set of high-resolution simulations of the merging process of two white dwarfs. Methods: We use an up-to-date smoothed particle hydrodynamics code that incorporates very detailed input physics and an improved treatment of the artificial viscosity. Our simulations have been done using a large number of particles (\~{}4×10\^{}5) and covering the full range of masses and chemical compositions of the coalescing white dwarfs. We also compare the time evolution of the system during the first phases of the coalescence with what is obtained using a simplified treatment of mass transfer; we discuss in detail the characteristics of the final configuration; we assess the possible observational signatures of the merger, such as the associated gravitational waveforms and the fallback X-ray flares; and we study the long-term evolution of the coalescence. Results: The mass transfer rates obtained during the first phases of the merger episode agree with the theoretical expectations. In all the cases studied, the merged configuration is a central compact object surrounded by a self-gravitating Keplerian disk, except in the case where two equal-mass white dwarfs coalesce. Conclusions: We find that the overall evolution the system and the main characteristics of the of the final object agree with other previous studies in which lower resolutions were used. We also find that the fallback X-ray luminosities are close to 1047 erg/s. The gravitational waveforms are characterized by the sudden disappearance of the signal in a few orbital periods.},

The turbulent motions induced by the convective burning phase in the He envelope become strong enough to influence the propagation of burning fronts and may result in the onset of a detonation. Such an outcome would yield radioactive isotopes and a faint rapidly rising thermonuclear ".Ia" supernova. In this paper, we present hydrodynamic explosion models and observable outcomes of these He shell detonations for a range of initial core and envelope masses. The peak UVOIR bolometric luminosities range by a factor of 10 (from 5 ×1041 to 5 ×1042 erg s-1), and the R-band peak varies from M R,peak = -15 to -18. The rise times in all bands are very rapid (<10 days), but the decline rate is slower in the red than in the blue due to a secondary near-IR brightening. The nucleosynthesis primarily yields heavy α-chain elements (40Ca through 56Ni) and unburnt He. Thus, the spectra around peak light lack signs of intermediate-mass elements and are dominated by Ca II and Ti II features, with the caveat that our radiative transfer code does not include the nonthermal effects necessary to produce He features.},

	N2 = {The Galactic Center is an excellent laboratory for studying phenomena and physical occurring in many other galactic nuclei. The Center of our Milky Way is by far the closest galactic nucleus, and observations with exquisite resolution and sensitivity cover 18 orders of magnitude in energy of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretical simulations have become increasingly more powerful in explaining these measurements. This review summarizes the recent progress in observational and theoretical work on the central parsec, with a strong emphasis on the current empirical evidence for a central massive black hole and on the properties of the surrounding dense star cluster. We present the current evidence, from the analysis of the orbits of more than two dozen stars and from the measurements of the size and motion of the central compact radio source, Sgr A*, that this radio source must be a massive black hole of about 4.4 x 106 M{\_}\odot, beyond any reasonable doubt. We report what is known about the structure and evolution of the dense nuclear star cluster surrounding this black hole, including the astounding fact that stars have been forming in the vicinity of Sgr A* recently, apparently with a top-heavy stellar mass function. We discuss a dense concentration of fainter stars centered in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole, three of which have orbital peri-bothroi of less than one light day. This 'S-star cluster' appears to consist mainly of young early-type stars, in contrast to the predicted properties of an equilibrium 'stellar cusp' around a black hole. This constitutes a remarkable and presently not fully understood 'paradox of youth'. We also summarize more briefly what is known about the emission properties of the accreting gas onto Sgr A* and how this emission is beginning to delineate the physical properties in the hot accretion zone around the event horizon.},

Following the first encounter, a main-sequence star is well modeled by an irrotational Reimann ellipsoid, a triaxial configuration with no vorticity. Viscosity is found to be critical to understanding the evolution of these systems, because viscosity regulates the growth of oscillations and the amount of damage done to the star. The results of tidal captures are sensitive to the properties of the global cluster through the density of the local environment and the typical mass of the main-sequence star.},

	N2 = {The tidal breakup of binary star systems by the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of the galaxy has been suggested as the source of both the observed sample of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) in the halo of the Galaxy and the S stars that remain in tight orbits around Sgr A*. Here, we use a post-Newtonian N-body code to study the dynamics of main-sequence binaries on highly elliptical bound orbits whose periapsides lie close to the SMBH, determining the properties of ejected and bound stars as well as collision products. Unlike previous studies, we follow binaries that remain bound for several revolutions around the SMBH, finding that in the case of relatively large periapsides and highly inclined binaries the Kozai resonance can lead to large periodic oscillations in the internal binary eccentricity and inclination. Collisions and mergers of the binary elements are found to increase significantly for multiple orbits around the SMBH, while HVSs are primarily produced during a binary's first passage. This process can lead to stellar coalescence and eventually serve as an important source of young stars at the Galactic center.},

	N2 = {We investigate the estimation of orbital parameters by least-χ2 Keplerian fits to radial velocity (RV) data using synthetic data sets. We find that while the fitted period is fairly accurate, the best-fit eccentricity and Mpsini are systematically biased upward from the true values for low signal-to-noise ratio, K/σ<\~{}3, and a moderate number of observations, Nobs<\~{}60, leading to a suppression of the number of nearly circular orbits. Assuming intrinsic distributions of orbital parameters, we generate a large number of mock RV data sets and study the selection effect on the eccentricity distribution. We find that the overall detection efficiency only mildly decreases with eccentricity. This is because although high-eccentricity orbits are more difficult to sample, they also have larger RV amplitudes for fixed planet mass and orbital semimajor axis. Thus, the primary source of uncertainty in the eccentricity distribution comes from biases in Keplerian fits to detections with low-amplitude and/or small Nobs, rather than from selection effects. Our results suggest that the abundance of low-eccentricity exoplanets may be underestimated in the current sample, and we urge caution in interpreting the eccentricity distributions of low-amplitude detections in future RV samples.},

If the planet travels on a circular orbit, the accretion process is described by two dimensionless parameters r and s, which measure the ratio of the planet's radius to its Hill radius and the ratio of the rms radial velocity of the planetesimals to the shear across the Hill radius, respectively. Using a combination of analytic arguments and numerical simulations, we derive the mass and angular momentum accretion rates and their scaling with r and s. By introducing an additional parameter, the effective mass of the planetesimals relative to the planet, we can derive the obliquities and spins arising from the stochastic nature of the accretion process. Our results are consistent with those of previous calculations by Lissauer and Kary (1991) wherever there is overlap in parameter space. In particular, we conclude that ordered accretion from a uniform or slowly varying disk of small bodies cannot result in rotation as rapid as that of earth or Mars for any value of the disk velocity dispersion s. The spin rates of these planets are most naturally explained as arising from one or a few 'giant' impacts by planetesimals.},

Unfortunately, the RM effect does not constrain the complement misalignment angle between the orbit of the planet and the spin of its host star along the line of sight (LOS). I use a simple model of stellar rotation benchmarked with observational data to statistically identify 10 exoplanet systems from a sample of 75 for which there is likely a significant degree of spin-orbit misalignment along the LOS: HAT-P-7, HAT-P-14, HAT-P-16, HD 17156, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, TrES-4, WASP-1, WASP-12, and WASP-14. All 10 systems have host stellar masses M * in the range 1.2 M sun <\~{} M * <\~{} 1.5 M sun, and the probability of this occurrence by chance is less than one in ten thousand. In addition, the planets in the candidate-misaligned systems are preferentially massive and eccentric. The coupled distribution of misalignment from the RM effect and from this analysis suggests that transiting exoplanets are more likely to be spin-orbit aligned than expected given predictions for a transiting planet population produced entirely by planet-planet scattering or Kozai cycles and tidal friction. For that reason, there are likely two populations of close-in exoplanet systems: a population of aligned systems and a population of apparently misaligned systems in which the processes that lead to misalignment or to the survival of misaligned systems operate more efficiently in systems with massive stars and planets.},

	N2 = {We consider the tidal excitation of modes in a binary system of arbitrary eccentricity. For a circular orbit, the modes generally undergo forced oscillation with a period equal to the orbital period (T). For an eccentric orbit, the amplitude of each tidally excited mode can be written approximately as the sum of an oscillatory term that varies sinusoidally with the mode frequency and a "static" term that follows the time dependence of the tidal forcing function. The oscillatory term falls off exponentially with increasing b (defined as the ratio of the periastron passage time to the mode period), whereas the "static" term is independent of bα. For small-bαmodes (bα≍1), the two terms are comparable, and the magnitude of the mode amplitude is nearly constant over the orbit. For large-bαmodes (bα≳a few), the oscillatory term is very small compared with the "static" term, in which case the mode amplitude, like the tidal force, varies as the distance cubed. For main-sequence stars, p-, f-, and low-order g-modes generally have large bαand hence small amplitudes of oscillation. High overtone g-modes, however, have small overlap with the tidal forcing function. Thus, we expect an intermediate overtone g-mode with bα˜1 to have the largest oscillation amplitude. In addition, we find that the mode amplitude is independent of the dissipation rate except when the mode frequency is very close to orbital resonance or the damping time is less than T; both conditions are unlikely. Moreover, orbital evolution causes a resonant mode to move off resonance with time. This severely limits the amplitude of modes near resonance. Rotation of the star shifts the mode frequencies but otherwise has little effect on the mode amplitude (provided that the rotation rate is small). Hence, tidally excited modes have amplitudes and phases that are periodic with period T, making them readily distinguishable from oscillations excited by other mechanisms. We apply our work to the SMC radio pulsar PSR J0045 - 7319, which is believed to be in a highly eccentric orbit with a 10 Msun B star. We find that the g7 mode (with period 1.07 days) of the B star has the largest oscillation amplitude, with a flux variation of 2.3 mmag and a surface velocity of 70 ms-1. The flux variation at periastron summed over all modes, is about 10 mmag; in addition, we propose that the shape of the light curve can be utilized to determine the orbital inclination angle. The apsidal motion of this system, calculated without the usual static approximation, is larger than that predicted by the classical apsidal formula by about 1{\%}. For the PSR B1259 - 63 system, the tidal amplitude of the Be star companion is smaller by a factor of 70 because of its larger periastron distance. To understand the dependence of tidal excitation on stellar structure, detailed numerical calculations of modes of a general polytropic star are also presented.},

	N2 = {Based on formulations by Heggie and by Eggleton, we present an efficient method for calculating self-consistently the tidal, spin, and dynamical evolution of a many-body system, here with particular emphasis on planetary systems. The star and innermost planet (or in general the closest pair of bodies in the system) are endowed with structure while the other bodies are treated as point masses. The evolution of the spin rates and obliquities of the extended bodies are calculated (for arbitrary initial obliquities), as is the tidal evolution of the innermost orbit. In addition, the radius of the innermost planet is evolved according to its ability to efficiently dissipate tidal energy. Relativistic effects are included to post-Newtonian order. For resonant systems such as GJ 876, the evolution equations must be integrated directly to allow for variation of the semimajor axes (other than from tidal damping) and for the possibility of instability. For systems such as Upsilon Andromedae in which the period ratio of the two inner planets is small, the innermost orbit may be averaged producing (in this case) a 50-fold reduction in the calculation time. In order to illustrate the versatility of the formulation, we consider three hypothetical primitive Earth-Moon-Sun-Jupiter systems. The parameters and initial conditions are identical in the first two models except for the Love number of the Earth, which results in dramatically different evolutionary paths. The third system is one studied by Touma \& Wisdom and serves as a test of the numerical formulations presented here by reproducing two secular mean motion resonances (the evection and eviction resonances). The methods may be used for any system of bodies.},

Primary modes destabilize high-degree g-modes of half their frequency (daughter modes) by 3-mode coupling in radiative zones. For Sun-like stars, the growth time ≡η-1≍4E-½0,42 days, where E0,42 is the initial energy of the primary mode in units of 1042 ergs, and the number of daughter modes N ˜1010E5/40,42. The growth rate is approximately equal to the angular frequency of the primary mode times its dimensionless radial amplitude, δR/R* ≍0.002E-½0,42. Although the daughter modes are limited by their own nonlinearities, collectively they absorb most of the primary mode's energy after a time ˜10ɛ-1 provided E0 > 1040 ergs. This is orders of magnitude smaller than usual radiative damping time. In fact, nonlinear mode interaction may be the dominant damping process if E0 ≥1037 ergs. These results have obvious application to tidally captured main-sequence globular cluster stars of mass ≥0.5 Msun; the tidal energy is dissipated in the radiative core of the star in about a month, which is less than the initial orbital period. Nonlinear mode coupling is a less efficient damping process for fully convective stars, which lack g-modes. In convective stars, most of the tidal energy is in the quadrupole f-modes, which nonresonantly excite high-order p-modes of degree 0, 2, and 4. The resultant short-wavelength waves are more efficiently dissipated. The nonlinear damping time for f-modes is shown to be proportional to 1/E0; this damping time is about 30 days for E0 ≍1045 ergs expected in tidal captures. However, at such a large energy the system is very nonlinear: 4-mode and higher order couplings are as important as 3-mode couplings.},

	N2 = {We study the effect of rotation on the excitation of internal oscillation modes of a star by the external gravitational potential of its companion. Unlike the nonrotating case, there are difficulties with the usual mode decomposition for rotating stars because of the asymmetry between modes propagating in the direction of rotation and those propagating opposite to it. For an eccentric binary system, we derive general expressions for the energy transfer, Delta Es, and the corresponding angular momentum transfer, Delta Js, in a periastron passage when there is no initial oscillation present in the star. Except when a nearly precise orbital resonance occurs (i.e., the mode frequency equals multiple of the orbital frequency), Delta Es is very close to the steady state mode energy in the tide in the presence of dissipation. It is shown that stellar rotation can change the strength of dynamical tide significantly. In particular, retrograde rotation with respect to the orbit increases the energy transfer by bringing lower order g-modes (or f-modes for convective stars), which couple more strongly to the tidal potential, into closer resonances with the orbital motion of the companion. We apply our general formalism to the problems of tidal capture binary formation and the orbital evolution of the PSR J0045-7319/B star binary. Stellar rotation changes the critical impact parameter for binary capture. Although the enhancement (by retrograde rotation) in the capture cross section is at most \~{}20{\%}, the probability that the captured system survives disruption/merging and therefore becomes a binary can be significantly larger. It is found that in order to explain the observed rapid orbital decay of the PSR J0045-7319 binary system, retrograde rotation in the B star is required.},

	N2 = {In their HST/NICMOS observations, Terebey et al. 1998 detected a candidate protoplanet, TMR-1C, that lies at a separation of about 10" (\~{}1000 AU) from the Class I protobinary TMR-1 (IRAS 04361+2547). A narrow filament-like structure was observed extending south-east from the central proto-binary system towards TMR-1C, suggesting a morphology in which the candidate protoplanet may have been ejected from the TMR-1 system. Follow-up low-resolution spectroscopy could not confirm if this object is a protoplanet or a low-luminosity background star. We present two epochs of near-infrared photometric observations obtained at the CFHT of TMR-1C. The time span of \~{}7 years between the two sets of observations provides with an opportunity to, (a) check for any photometric variability similar to that observed among young stellar objects, which would indicate the youth of this source, and, (b) determine the proper motion. TMR-1C displays large photometric variability between 1 and 2 mag in both the H- and Ks-bands. From our 2002 observations, we find a (H-Ks) color of 0.3 mag, which is much bluer than the value of 1.3 mag reported by T98 from HST observations. Also, we observe brightening in both the H- and Ks-bands when the colors are bluer, i.e. the object gets redder as it becomes fainter. We have explored the possible origins for the observed variability, and find extinction due to the presence of circumstellar material to be the most likely scenario. The observed large-amplitude photometric variations, and the possible presence of a circumstellar disk, are strong arguments against this object being an old background star.},

	N2 = {TMR-1 (IRAS\~{}04361+2547) is a class\~{}I proto-stellar source located in the nearby Taurus star-forming region. Its circumstellar environment is characterized by extended dust emission with complex structures and conspicuous filaments. A faint companion, called TMR-1C, located near the proto-star had been detected in previous studies, but its nature as a very young substellar object remained inconclusive. To improve the constraints on the nature of TMR-1C, and to investigate the process of very low-mass star formation in the TMR-1 system we use very sensitive infrared imaging observations as well as NIR spectroscopy. We construct the SED of TMR-1C over a much larger wavelength range as had been possible in previous work and compare it with models of extincted background stars, young sub-stellar objects, and very low-mass stars with circumstellar disk and envelope emission. We also search for additional low-luminosity objects in the immediate environment of the TMR-1, study the surrounding NIR dust morphology, and analyse the emission line spectrum of a filamentary structure in the physical context of a bow-shock model. We find that the observed SED of TMR-1C is inconsistent with an extincted background star, nor can be fitted with available models for a young extremely low-mass (<12M{\_}Jup) object. Our near-IR spectrum indicates an effective temperature of at least \~{}3000K. Based on a good match of TMR-1C's SED with radiation transfer models of young stellar objects with circumstellar disks, we propose that TMR-1C is most likely a very low-mass star with M\~{}0.1-0.2M{\_}sun surrounded by a circumstellar disk with high inclination, i>80deg. Moreover, we detect an additional very faint source, which we call TMR-1D, and that shows a quite striking symmetry in position with TMR-1C. TMR-1C and TMR-1D may have been formed from a common triggered star-formation event, caused by... (abstract abridged)},

	N2 = {As an eccentric white dwarf-compact object binary shrinks and circularizes because of gravitational radiation, it will pass through resonances when harmonics of the orbital frequency match one of the white dwarf's normal mode eigenfrequencies. A formalism for calculating the resonant energy transfer is presented, both when the when the perturbation of the orbit by the excited mode is neglected (resonances without back reaction), and when the perturbation is included (resonances with back reaction). It is found that back reaction changes the resonant energy transfer both qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, the energy transfer with back reaction is shown to be always positive, to lowest order in the rate of dissipation by gravitational radiation. Numerical simulations of resonant mode excitation and non-linear evolution of white dwarf oscillations are also considered. A hydrodynamics code for studying this is described. Results from several test problems and simulations of resonant tidal excitation are presented. If the amplitude of an excited mode is driven high enough, the mode may damp non-linearly and heat the white dwarf. If the temperature of the star can be raised to a critical value, then the star may undergo a thermonuclear detonation that results in a Type Ia supernova. The feasibility of such a detonation via excitation of quadrupolar {$[$}function of{$]$}-modes is studied. It is found that a system with a 1.4 {$[$}Special characters omitted.{$]$} companion is not viable, but, for companion masses of \~{} 10--10 5 {$[$}Special characters omitted.{$]$} , there exist regions in the parameter space where the white dwarf can be detonated. The ejecta from such a detonation are expected to remain trapped in orbit around the companion in most cases. A preliminary evaluation of the importance of tidal resonances for gravitational wave observations of capture sources with central masses of \~{} 10 6 {$[$}Special characters omitted.{$]$} is also presented. The excitation of {$[$}function of{$]$}-modes is found to be unimportant, however, but g -mode are shown to potentially introduce significant errors in parameter estimation for such systems. The exact magnitude of the errors depends upon the density of resonances during the period of observation, and therefore upon details of the white dwarf model.},

The base of the convection zone can be identified as a local maximum in the relative angular momentum after subtracting the contribution of the solid-body rotation. The angular momentum as a function of radius shows the strongest temporal variation near the tachocline. This variation extends into the lower convection zone and into the radiative interior and is related to the 1.3 yr periodicity found in the equatorial rotation rate of the tachocline. In the upper convection zone, we find a small systematic variation of the angular momentum that is related to torsional oscillations. The angular momentum integrated from the surface to a lower limit in the upper convection zone provides a hint that the torsional oscillation pattern extends deep into the convection zone. This is supported by other quantities such as the coefficients of a fit of Legendre polynomials to the rotation rates as a function of latitude. The temporal variation of the coefficient of P4, indicative of torsional oscillations, suggests that the signature of these flows in the inversion results extend to about r\~{}0.83Rsolar. With the lower limit of integration placed in the middle or lower convection zone, the angular momentum fluctuates about the mean without apparent trend, i.e., the angular momentum is conserved within the measurement errors. However, when integrated over the layers slightly below the convection zone (0.60-0.71Rsolar), the angular momentum shows the 1.3 yr period and hints at a long-term trend that might be related to the solar activity cycle.},

	N2 = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02-10 AU) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90{\%} of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ``hot Neptunes'' have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of \~{}0.30-0.45 RJ are expected. Water planets are \~{}40{\%}-50{\%} larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler.},

	N2 = {The tidal evolution of hot Jupiters may change the efficiency of transit surveys of stellar clusters. The orbital decay that hot Jupiters suffer may result in their destruction, leaving fewer transiting planets in older clusters. We calculate the impact tidal evolution has for different assumed stellar populations, including that of 47\~{}Tuc, a globular cluster that was the focus of an intense HST search for transits. We find that in older clusters one expects to detect fewer transiting planets by a factor of two for surveys sensitive to Jupiter-like planets in orbits out to 0.5\~{}AU, and up to a factor of 25 for surveys sensitive to Jupiter-like planets in orbits out to 0.08\~{}AU. Additionally, tidal evolution affects the distribution of transiting planets as a function of semi-major axis, producing larger orbital period gaps for transiting planets as the age of the cluster increases. Tidal evolution can explain the lack of detected exoplanets in 47\~{}Tuc without invoking other mechanisms. Four open clusters residing within the {\{}\em Kepler{\}} fields of view have ages that span 0.4-8\~{}Gyr-if {\{}\em Kepler{\}} can observe a significant number of planets in these clusters, it will provide key tests for our tidal evolution hypothesis. Finally, our results suggest that observers wishing to discover transiting planets in clusters must have sufficient accuracy to detect lower mass planets, search larger numbers of cluster members, or have longer observation windows to be confident that a significant number of transits will occur for a population of stars.},

	N2 = {Radial-velocity planet search campaigns are now beginning to detect low-mass "Super-Earth" planets, with minimum masses M sin i < 10 M{\_}earth. Using two independently-developed methods, we have derived detection limits from nearly four years of the highest-precision data on 24 bright, stable stars from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search. Both methods are more conservative than a human analysing an individual observed data set, as is demonstrated by the fact that both techniques would detect the radial velocity signals announced as exoplanets for the 61 Vir system in 50{\%} of trials. There are modest differences between the methods which can be recognised as arising from particular criteria that they adopt. What both processes deliver is a quantitative selection process such that one can use them to draw quantitative conclusions about planetary frequency and orbital parameter distribution from a given data set. Averaging over all 24 stars, in the period range P<300 days and the eccentricity range 0.0<e<0.6, we could have detected 99{\%} of planets with velocity amplitudes K>7.1 m/s. For the best stars in the sample, we are able to detect or exclude planets with K>3 m/s, corresponding to minimum masses of 8 M{\_}earth (P=5 days) or 17 M{\_}earth (P=50 days). Our results indicate that the observed "period valley," a lack of giant planets (M>100 M{\_}earth) with periods between 10-100 days, is indeed real. However, for planets in the mass range 10-100 M{\_}earth, our results suggest that the deficit of such planets may be a result of selection effects.},

	N2 = {In Paper I, we followed the evolution of binary stars as they orbited near the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic center, noting the cases in which the two stars would come close enough together to collide. In this paper, we replace the point-mass stars by fluid realizations, and use a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code to follow the close interactions. We model the binary components as main-sequence stars with initial masses of 1, 3, and 6 solar masses, and with chemical composition profiles taken from stellar evolution codes. Outcomes of the close interactions include mergers, collisions that leave both stars intact, and ejection of one star at high velocity accompanied by capture of the other star into a tight orbit around the SMBH. For the first time, we follow the evolution of the collision products for many (gsim 100) orbits around the SMBH. Stars that are initially too small to be tidally disrupted by the SMBH can be puffed up by close encounters or collisions, with the result that tidal stripping occurs in subsequent periapse passages. In these cases, mass loss occurs episodically, sometimes for hundreds of orbits before the star is completely disrupted. Repeated tidal flares, of either increasing or decreasing intensity, are a predicted consequence. In collisions involving a low-mass and a high-mass star, the merger product acquires a high core hydrogen abundance from the smaller star, effectively resetting the nuclear evolution "clock" to a younger age. Elements like Li, Be, and B that can exist only in the outermost envelope of a star are severely depleted due to envelope ejection during collisions and due to tidal forces from the SMBH. Tidal spin-up can occur due to either a collision or tidal torque by the SMBH at periapsis. However, in the absence of collisions, tidal spin-up of stars is only important in a narrow range of periapse distances, r t/2 <\~{} r per <\~{} r t, with r t the tidal disruption radius. We discuss the implications of these results for the formation of the S-stars and the hypervelocity stars.},

	N2 = {Most of the observed extrasolar planets are found on tight and often eccentric orbits. The high eccentricities are not easily explained by planet-formation models, which predict that planets should be on rather circular orbits. Here we explore whether fly-bys involving planetary systems with properties similar to those of the gas giants in the Solar system can produce planets with properties similar to the observed planets. Using numerical simulations, we show that fly-bys can cause the immediate ejection of planets, and sometimes also lead to the capture of one or more planets by the intruder. More common, however, is that fly-bys only perturb the orbits of planets, sometimes leaving the system in an unstable state. Over time-scales of a few million to several hundred million years after the fly-by, this perturbation can trigger planet-planet scatterings, leading to the ejection of one or more planets. For example, in the case of the four gas giants of the Solar system, the fraction of systems from which at least one planet is ejected more than doubles in 108 yr after the fly-by. The remaining planets are often left on more eccentric orbits, similar to the eccentricities of the observed extrasolar planets. We combine our results of how fly-bys affect Solar-system-like planetary systems, with the rate at which encounters in young stellar clusters occur. For example, we measure the effects of fly-bys on the four gas giants in the Solar system. We find, that for such systems, between 5 and 15 per cent suffer ejections of planets in 108 yr after fly-bys in typical open clusters. Thus, encounters in young stellar clusters can significantly alter the properties of any planets orbiting stars in clusters. As a large fraction of stars which populate the solar neighbourhood form in stellar clusters, encounters can significantly affect the properties of the observed extrasolar planets.},

	N2 = {The discovery of over 400 extrasolar planets allows us to statistically test our understanding of the formation and dynamics of planetary systems via numerical simulations. Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without gas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the observed systems by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely packed when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable within the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small semimajor axes a of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as the standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line. In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in dissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the observed a and e distributions simultaneously. We adopt initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet formation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution and planet migration, by using a hybrid N-body and one-dimensional gas disk code. We also take into account eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation resonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the a distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the e distribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there may be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our simulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in mean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's perturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed rate of MMRs. We also find a much lower occurrence of planets on retrograde orbits than the current observations of close-in planets suggest.},

	N2 = {We examine the radius evolution of close in giant planets with a planet evolution model that couples the orbital-tidal and thermal evolution. For 45 transiting systems, we compute a large grid of cooling/contraction paths forward in time, starting from a large phase space of initial semimajor axes and eccentricities. Given observational constraints at the current time for a given planet (semimajor axis, eccentricity, and system age), we find possible evolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated radii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First, planets start their evolution at larger semimajor axis, allowing them to contract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can significantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this effect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the orbit is proceeded by a long period while the semimajor axis slowly decreases. Some systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with our coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4. This increases the number of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many as 35 for our standard case, but for some of these systems we are required to be viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation. This is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism to explain most inflated radii. Also, large initial eccentricities would have to be common. We also investigate the evolution of models that have a floor on the eccentricity, as may be due to a perturber. In this scenario, we match the extremely large radius of WASP-12b. This work may cast some doubt on our ability to accurately determine the interior heavy element enrichment of normal, noninflated close in planets, because of our dearth of knowledge about these planets' previous orbital-tidal histories. Finally, we find that the end state of most close in planetary systems is disruption of the planet as it moves ever closer to its parent star.},

	N2 = {It has been widely thought that measuring the misalignment angle between the orbital plane of a transiting exoplanet and the spin of its host star was a good discriminator between different migration processes for hot-Jupiters. Specifically, well-aligned hot-Jupiter systems (as measured by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect) were thought to have formed via migration through interaction with a viscous disc, while misaligned systems were thought to have undergone a more violent dynamical history. These conclusions were based on the assumption that the planet-forming disc was well-aligned with the host star. Recent work by Lai et al. has challenged this assumption, and proposes that the star-disc interaction in the pre-main sequence phase can exert a torque on the star and change its rotation axis angle. We have estimated the stellar rotation axis of a sample of stars which host spatially resolved debris disks. Comparison of our derived stellar rotation axis inclination angles with the geometrically measured debris-disk inclinations shows no evidence for a misalignment between the two.},

	N2 = {Magnetic interactions between a protostar and its accretion disc can induce warping in the disc and produce secular changes in the stellar spin direction, so that the spin axis may not always be perpendicular to the disc. This may help to explain the 7$\,^{\circ}$misalignment between the ecliptic plane of the Solar system and the Sun's equatorial plane as well as play a role in producing the recently observed spin-orbit misalignment in a number of exoplanetary systems. We study the dynamics of warped protoplanetary discs under the combined effects of magnetic warping/precession torques and internal stresses in the disc, including viscous damping of warps and propagation of bending waves. We show that when the outer disc axis is misaligned with the stellar spin axis, the disc evolves towards a warped steady state on a time-scale that depends on the disc viscosity or the bending wave propagation speed, but in all cases is much shorter than the time-scale for the spin evolution (of the order of a million years). Moreover, for the most likely physical parameters characterizing magnetic protostars, circumstellar discs and their interactions, the steady-state disc, averaged over the stellar rotation period, has a rather small warp such that the whole disc lies approximately in a single plane determined by the outer disc boundary conditions, although more extreme parameters may give rise to larger disc warps. In agreement with our recent analysis based on flat discs, we find that the back-reaction magnetic torques of the slightly warped disc on the star can either align the stellar spin axis with the disc axis or push it towards misalignment, depending on the parameters of the star-disc system. This implies that newly formed planetary systems may have a range of inclination angles between the stellar spin axis and the orbital angular momentum axis of the planetary orbits.},

The recently discovered transiting planet WASP-12b has a mass M = 1.4+/-0.1 Jupiter masses (MJ), a mean orbital distance of only 3.1 stellar radii (meaning it is subject to intense tidal forces), and a period of 1.1days. Its radius 1.79+/-0.09RJ is unexpectedly large and its orbital eccentricity 0.049+/-0.015 is even more surprising because such close orbits are usually quickly circularized. Here we report an analysis of its properties, which reveals that the planet is losing mass to its host star at a rate of about 10-7MJ per year. The planet's surface is distorted by the star's gravity and the light curve produced by its prolate shape will differ by about ten per cent from that of a spherical planet. We conclude that dissipation of the star's tidal perturbation in the planet's convective envelope provides the energy source for its large volume. We predict up to 10mJy CO band-head (2.292μm) emission from a tenuous disk around the host star, made up of tidally stripped planetary gas. It may also contain a detectable resonant super-Earth, as a hypothetical perturber that continually stirs up WASP-12b's eccentricity.},

	N2 = {The process of tidal dissipation inside Jupiter is not yet understood. Its tidal quality factor (Q) is inferred to lie between 105 and 106. Having studied the structure and properties of inertial modes in a neutrally buoyant, coreless, uniformly rotating sphere in a companion paper, we examine here their effects on tidal dissipation. The rate of dissipation caused by resonantly excited inertial modes depends on the following three parameters: how well they are coupled to the tidal potential, how strongly they are dissipated (by the turbulent viscosity), and how densely distributed they are in frequency. We find that as a function of tidal frequency, the Q-value exhibits large fluctuations, with its maximum value set by the group of inertial modes that satisfy δω\~{}γ, where δωis the group's typical offset from an exact resonance and γare the modes' turbulent damping rates. These are intermediate-order inertial modes with wavenumber λ\~{}60, and they are excited to a small surface displacement amplitude of order 103 cm. The Q-value drops much below the maximum value whenever a lower order mode happens to be in resonance. In our model, inertial modes shed their tidally acquired energy very close to the surface within a narrow latitudinal zone (the ``singularity belt''), and the tidal luminosity escapes freely out of the planet. The strength of coupling between the tidal potential and inertial modes is sensitive to the presence of density discontinuities inside Jupiter. In the case of a discreet density jump, as may be caused by the transition between metallic and molecular hydrogen, we find a time-averaged Q\~{}107, with a small but nonnegligible chance (\~{}10{\%}) that the current Q-value falls within the empirically determined range. But when such a jump does not exist, Q\~{}109. Even though it remains unclear whether tidal dissipation due to resonant inertial modes is the correct answer to the problem, it is impressive that even our simple treatment taking planetary rotation into account already leads to a 3-5 orders of magnitude stronger damping than when rotation is ignored. Moreover, our conclusions are not affected by the presence of a small solid core, a different prescription for the turbulent viscosity, or nonlinear mode coupling, but they depend critically on the static stability in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter. This is currently uncertain. Lastly, we compare our results with those from a competing work by Ogilvie \& Lin and discuss the prospect of extending this theory to exo-Jupiters, which appear to possess Q-values similar to that of Jupiter.},

In general, ψcannot be measured, but for transiting planets one can measure the angle λbetween the sky projections of the two axes via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Here, we show how to combine measurements of λin different systems to derive statistical constraints on ψ. We apply the method to 11 published measurements of λ, using two different single-parameter distributions to describe the ensemble. First, assuming a Rayleigh distribution (or more precisely, a Fisher distribution on a sphere), we find that the peak value is less than 22$\,^{\circ}$with 95{\%} confidence. Second, assuming that a fraction f of the orbits have random orientations relative to the stars, and the remaining fraction (1 - f) are perfectly aligned, we find f < 0.36 with 95{\%} confidence. This latter model fits the data better than the Rayleigh distribution, mainly because the XO-3 system was found to be strongly misaligned while the other 10 systems are consistent with perfect alignment. If the XO-3 result proves robust, then our results may be interpreted as evidence for two distinct modes of planet migration.},

	N2 = {Many extrasolar planets orbit sufficiently close to their host stars that significant tidal interactions can be expected, resulting in an evolution of the spin and orbital properties of the planets. The accompanying dissipation of energy can also be an important source of heat, leading to the inflation of short-period planets and even mass loss through Roche lobe overflow. Tides may therefore play an important role in determining the observed distributions of mass, orbital period, and eccentricity of the extrasolar planets. In addition, tidal interactions between gaseous giant planets in the solar system and their moons are thought to be responsible for the orbital migration of the satellites, leading to their capture into resonant configurations. Traditionally, the efficiency of tidal dissipation is simply parameterized by a quality factor Q, which depends, in principle, in an unknown way on the frequency and amplitude of the tidal forcing. In this paper we treat the underlying fluid dynamical problem with the aim of determining the efficiency of tidal dissipation in gaseous giant planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, or the short-period extrasolar planets. Efficient convection enforces a nearly adiabatic stratification in these bodies, which may or may not contain solid cores. With some modifications, our approach can also be applied to low-mass stars with extended convective envelopes. In cases of interest, the tidal forcing frequencies are typically comparable to the spin frequency of the planet but are small compared to its dynamical frequency. We therefore study the linearized response of a slowly and possibly differentially rotating planet to low-frequency tidal forcing. Convective regions of the planet support inertial waves, which possess a dense or continuous frequency spectrum in the absence of viscosity, while any radiative regions support generalized Hough waves. We formulate the relevant equations for studying the excitation of these disturbances and present a set of illustrative numerical calculations of the tidal dissipation rate. We argue that inertial waves provide a natural avenue for efficient tidal dissipation in most cases of interest. In the presence of a solid core, the excited disturbance tends to be localized on a web of rays rather than resembling a smooth eigenfunction. The resulting value of Q depends, in principle, in a highly erratic way on the forcing frequency, but we provide analytical and numerical evidence that the frequency-averaged dissipation rate may be asymptotically independent of the viscosity in the limit of small Ekman number. For a smaller viscosity, the tidal disturbance has a finer spatial structure and individual resonances are more pronounced. In short-period extrasolar planets, tidal dissipation via inertial waves becomes somewhat less efficient once they are spun down to a synchronous state. However, if the stellar irradiation of the planet leads to the formation of a radiative outer layer that supports generalized Hough modes, the tidal dissipation rate can be enhanced, albeit with significant uncertainty, through the excitation and damping of these waves. The dissipative mechanisms that we describe offer a promising explanation of the historical evolution and current state of the Galilean satellites, as well as the observed circularization of the orbits of short-period extrasolar planets.},

This approach enables us to extend previous work of Ivanov \& Papaloizou to consider planet models with solid cores and to avoid making an anelastic approximation. We obtain a power spectrum of the tidal response of coreless models which enables global inertial modes to be identified. Their frequencies are found to be in good agreement with those obtained using either a WKBJ approach or the anelastic spectral approach adopted in previous work for small planet rotation rates. We also find that the dependence of the normal mode frequencies on the planet angular velocity in the case of higher rotation rates can for the most part be understood by applying first-order perturbation theory to the anelastic modes. We calculate the energy and angular momentum exchanged as a result of the tidal encounter and for coreless models again find good agreement with results obtained using the anelastic spectral method. Models with a solid core showed evidence of the emission of shear layers at critical latitudes and possibly wave attractors after the encounter, but the total energy exchanged during the encounter did not differ dramatically from the coreless case as long as the ratio of the core radius to the total radius was less than 50 per cent, there being hardly any difference at all when this ratio was less than 25 per cent of the total radius. We give a physical and mathematical interpretation of this result. Finally, we are able to validate the use of the anelastic approximation for both the work presented here and our previous work which led to estimates of circularization rates for planets in highly eccentric orbits.},

	N2 = {Inertial waves governed by Coriolis forces may play an important role in several astrophysical settings, such as tidal interactions, which may occur in extrasolar planetary systems and close binary systems, or in rotating compact objects emitting gravitational waves. Additionally, they are of interest in other research fields, e.g. in geophysics. However, their analysis is complicated by the fact that in the inviscid case the normal mode spectrum is either everywhere dense or continuous in any frequency interval contained within the inertial range. Moreover, the equations governing the corresponding eigenproblem are, in general, non-separable. In this paper we develop a consistent WKBJ formalism, together with a formal first-order perturbation theory for calculating the properties of the normal modes of a uniformly rotating coreless body (modelled as a polytrope and referred hereafter to as a planet) under the assumption of a spherically symmetric structure. The eigenfrequencies, spatial form of the associated eigenfunctions and other properties we obtained analytically using the WKBJ eigenfunctions are in good agreement with corresponding results obtained by numerical means for a variety of planet models even for global modes with a large-scale distribution of perturbed quantities. This indicates that even though they are embedded in a dense spectrum, such modes can be identified and followed as model parameters changed and that first-order perturbation theory can be applied. This is used to estimate corrections to the eigenfrequencies as a consequence of the anelastic approximation, which we argue here to be small when the rotation frequency is small. These are compared with simulation results in an accompanying paper with a good agreement between theoretical and numerical results. The results reported here may provide a basis of theoretical investigations of inertial waves in many astrophysical and other applications, where a rotating body can be modelled as a uniformly rotating barotropic object, for which the density has, close to its surface, an approximately power-law dependence on distance from the surface.},

In this work, we consider the diurnal Fourier harmonic of the stellar irradiation acting at the top of a radiative layer of a hot Jupiter with no clouds and winds. In the absence of the Coriolis force, the diurnal thermal forcing can excite internal waves propagating into the planet's interior when the thermal forcing period is longer than the sound crossing time of the planet's surface. When the Coriolis effect is taken into consideration, the latitude-dependent stellar heating can excite weak internal waves (g modes) and/or strong baroclinic Rossby waves (buoyant r modes) depending on the asynchrony of the planet. When the planet spins faster than its orbital motion (i.e. retrograde thermal forcing), these waves carry negative angular momentum and are damped by radiative loss as they propagate downwards from the upper layer of the radiative zone. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the lower layer of the radiative zone to the upper layer and generates a vertical shear. We estimate the resulting internal torques for different rotation periods based on the parameters of HD209458b.},

	N2 = {Asynchronous rotation and orbital eccentricity lead to time-dependent irradiation of the close-in gas giant exoplanets---the hot Jupiters. This time-dependent surface heating gives rise to fluid motions which propagate throughout the planet. We investigate the ability of this "thermal tide" to produce a quadrupole moment which can couple to the stellar gravitational tidal force. While previous investigations discussed planets with solid surfaces, here we focus on entirely fluid planets in order to understand gas giants with small cores. The Coriolis force, thermal diffusion, and self-gravity of the perturbations are ignored for simplicity. First, we examine the response to thermal forcing through analytic solutions of the fluid equations which treat the forcing frequency as a small parameter. In the "equilibrium tide" limit of zero frequency, fluid motion is present but does not induce a quadrupole moment. In the next approximation, finite frequency corrections to the equilibrium tide do lead to a nonzero quadrupole moment, the sign of which torques the planet away from synchronous spin. We then numerically solve the boundary value problem for the thermally forced, linear response of a planet with neutrally stratified interior and a stably stratified envelope. The numerical results find quadrupole moments in agreement with the analytic non-resonant result at a sufficiently long forcing period. Surprisingly, in the range of forcing periods of 1-30 days, the induced quadrupole moments can be far larger than the analytic result due to response of internal gravity waves which propagate in the radiative envelope. We discuss the relevance of our results for the spin, eccentricity, and thermal evolution of hot Jupiters.},

Clouds are identified in an automated manner through the main part of the survey data for all CO emission peaks exceeding 10 K (T*R). The measured parameters of identified clouds are analyzed and cross-correlated to compare with those of clouds in the Galactic disk. For the clouds in the Galactic center (GC), we find the scaling laws of the type σV\~{}S0.40 and MVT\~{}(LCO)0.88, which are similar to those of clouds in the Galactic disk. All the GC clouds identified have larger velocity widths and virial theorem masses each above the σV-S and LCO-MVT lines of the disk clouds. We diagnosed gravitational stabilities of identified clouds assuming that the disk clouds are nearly at the onset of gravitational instability. All the clouds and cloud complexes in the GC are gravitationally stable, indicating they are in equilibrium with high pressure in the GC environment. Gravitationally less stable clouds follow the main ridge of intense CO emission, part of which define two rigidly rotating molecular arms. The velocity dispersion of a cloud correlates inversely with the degree of gravitational instability. It is concluded that mechanisms such as orbit crowding at the inner Lindblad resonance may promote gravitational instability and subsequent star formation.},

For the first time, we have identified main-sequence stars in the Galactic center with initial masses well below 10 Msolar. We present the first determination of the initial mass function (IMF) for any population in the Galactic center, finding an IMF slope that is significantly more positive (Γ\~{}-0.65) than the average for young clusters elsewhere in the Galaxy (Γ\~{}-1.4). The apparent turnoffs in the color-magnitude diagrams suggest cluster ages that are consistent with the ages implied by the mixture of spectral types in the clusters; we find τage\~{}2+/-1 Myr for the Arches cluster and τage\~{}4+/-1 Myr for the Quintuplet. We estimate total cluster masses by adding the masses of observed stars down to the 50{\%} completeness limit and then extrapolating down to a lower mass cutoff of 1 Msolar. Using this method, we find >\~{}104 Msolar for the total mass of the Arches cluster. Such a determination for the Quintuplet cluster is complicated by the double-valued mass-magnitude relationship for clusters with ages >\~{}3 Myr. We find a lower limit of 6300 Msolar for the total cluster mass and suggest a best estimate of twice this value, which accounts for the outlying members of the cluster. Both clusters have masses that place them as the two most massive young clusters in the Galaxy.},

	N2 = {Integral field spectroscopy of the inner region of the Galactic Center, over a field of roughly 40 arcsec×40 arcsec was obtained at 2.06 μm (He I) and 2.16 μm (Brγ) using BEAR, an imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer, at spectral resolutions respectively of 52.9 km s-1 and 21.3 km s-1, and a spatial resolution of ≃0.5 arcsec. The analysis of the data was focused on the kinematics of the gas flows, traditionally called the ``Minispiral'', concentrated in the neighborhood of the central black hole, Sgr A*. From the decomposition into several velocity components (up to four) of the line profile extracted at each point of the field, velocity features were identified. Nine distinguishable structures are described: the standard Northern Arm, Eastern Arm, Bar, Western Arc, and five additional, coherently-moving patches of gas. From this analysis, the Northern Arm appears not limited, as usually thought, to the bright, narrow North-South lane seen on intensity images, but it consists instead of a weak, continuous, triangular-shaped surface, drawn out into a narrow stream in the vicinity of Sgr A* where it shows a strong velocity gradient, and a bright western rim. The Eastern Arm is split into three components (a Ribbon and a Tip, separated by a cavity, and an elongated feature parallel to the Ribbon: the Eastern Bridge). We also report extinction of some interstellar structures by other components, providing information on their relative position along the line of sight. A system of Keplerian orbits can be fitted to most of the Northern Arm, and the bright rim of this feature can be interpreted in terms of line-of-sight orbit crowding caused by the warping of the flowing surface at the western edge facing Sgr A*. These results lead to a new picture of the gas structures in Sgr A West, in which large-scale gas flows and isolated gas patches coexist in the gravitational field of the central Black Hole. The question of the origin of the ionized gas is addressed and a discussion of the lifetime of these features is presented.

	N2 = {High spatial resolution observations in the 1 to 3.5 μm/ region of the Galactic Center source known historically as IRS 13 are presented. They include ground-based adaptive optics images in the H, Kp (2.12/0.4 μm) and L bands, HST-NICMOS data in filters between 1.1 and 2.2 μm, and integral field spectroscopic data from BEAR, an Imaging FTS, in the He I 2.06 μm/ and the Brγline regions. Analysis of all these data provides a completely new picture of the main component, IRS 13E, which appears as a cluster of seven individual stars within a projected diameter of ˜0.5 arcsec (0.02 pc). The brightest sources, 13E1, 13E2, 13E3 which is detected as a binary, and 13E4, are all massive stars of different type. The star 13E1 is a luminous, blue object, with no detected emission line. 13E2 and 13E4 are two hot, high-mass emission line stars, 13E2 being at the WR stage and 13E4 a massive O-type star. In contrast, 13E3A and B are extremely red objects, proposed as other examples of dusty WR stars, like IRS 21 (Tanner et al. \cite{\{}tanner{\}}). All these sources have a common westward proper motion (Ott et al. \cite{\{}ott2{\}}) indicating they are bounded. Two other sources, detected after deconvolution of the AO images in the H and Kp bands, are also identified. One, that we call 13E5, is a red source similar to 13E3A and B, while the other one, 13E6, is probably a main sequence O star in front of the cluster. Considering this exceptional concentration of comoving massive hot stars, IRS 13E is proposed as the remaining core of a massive star cluster, which could harbor an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) (Portegies Zwart \& McMillan \cite{\{}zwart2){\}} of ˜1300 M{\.o}. This detection plays in favor of a scenario, first suggested by Gerhard (\cite{\{}gerhard{\}}), in which the helium stars and the other hot stars in the central parsec originate from the stripping of a massive cluster formed several tens of pc from the center. This cluster would have spiraled towards SgrA*, and IRS 13E would be its remnant. Furthermore, IRS 13E might be the second black hole needed according to a model by Hansen \& Milosavljevi{\'c}(\cite{\{}hansen{\}}) to drag massive main-sequence stars, in the required timescale, very close to the massive black hole. The detection of a discrete X-ray emission (Baganoff et al. \cite{\{}baganoff{\}}) at the IRS 13 position (within the positional accuracy) is examined in this context. This paper is based on observations obtained with the Adaptive Optics System Hokupa'a/Quirc, developed and operated by the University of Hawaii Adaptive Optics Group, with support from the National Science Foundation. On observations obtained with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, operated by the National Research Council of Canada, le Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France and the University of Hawaii.},

Outside the central cusp (R \~{} 1'') the majority of these O and Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars reside in a main clockwise system, plus a second, less prominent disk or streamer system at large angles with respect to the main system. Here we present the results from new observations of the GC with the AO-assisted near-infrared imager NACO and the integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the ESO/VLT. These include the detection of 27 new reliably measured W-R/O stars in the central 12'' and improved measurements of 63 previously detected stars, with proper motion uncertainties reduced by a factor of 4 compared to our earlier work. Based on the sample of 90 well measured W-R/O stars, we develop a detailed statistical analysis of their orbital properties and orientations. We show that half of the W-R/O stars are compatible with being members of a clockwise rotating system. The rotation axis of this system shows a strong transition from the inner to the outer regions as a function of the projected distance from Sgr A*. The main clockwise system either is either a strongly warped single disk with a thickness of about 10$\,^{\circ}$, or consists of a series of streamers with significant radial variation in their orbital planes. Eleven out of 61 clockwise moving stars have an angular separation of more than 30$\,^{\circ}$from the local angular momentum direction of the clockwise system. The mean eccentricity of the clockwise system is 0.36 $\pm$0.06. The distribution of the counterclockwise W-R/O star is not isotropic at the 98{\%} confidence level. It is compatible with a coherent structure such as stellar filaments, streams, small clusters or possibly a disk in a dissolving state: 10 out of 29 counterclockwise moving W-R/O stars have an angular separation of more than 30$\,^{\circ}$from the local angular momentum direction of the counterclockwise system. The observed disk warp and the steep surface density distribution favor in situ star formation in gaseous accretion disks as the origin of the young massive stars.},

Aims: The goals of this work are to develop a new method of separating early and late type stellar components of a dense stellar cluster based on narrow band filters, applying it to the central parsec of the GC, and conducting a population analysis of this area. Methods: We use AO assisted observations obtained at the ESO VLT in the NIR H-band and 7 intermediate bands covering the NIR K-band. A comparison of the resulting SEDs with a blackbody of variable extinction then allows us to determine the presence and strength of a CO absorption feature to distinguish between early and late type stars. Results: This new method is suitable for classifying K giants (and later), as well as B2 main sequence (and earlier) stars that are brighter than 15.5 mag in the K band in the central parsec. Compared to previous spectroscopic investigations that are limited to 13-14 mag, this represents a major improvement in the depth of the observations and reduces the needed observation time. Extremely red objects and foreground sources can also be reliably removed from the sample. Comparison to sources of known classification indicates that the method has an accuracy of better than \~{}87{\%}. We classify 312 stars as early type candidates out of a sample of 5914 sources. Several results, such as the shape of the KLF and the spatial distribution of both early and late type stars, confirm and extend previous works. The distribution of the early type stars can be fitted with a steep power law (β1'' = -1.49 $\pm$0.12), alternatively with a broken power law, β1-10'' = -1.08 $\pm$0.12, β10-20'' = -3.46 $\pm$0.58, since we find a drop in the early type density at \~{}10''. We also detect early type candidates outside of 0.5 pc in significant numbers for the first time. The late type density function shows an inversion in the inner 6'', with a power-law slope of βR<6'' = 0.17 $\pm$0.09. The late type KLF has a power-law slope of 0.30 $\pm$0.01, closely resembling the KLF obtained for the bulge of the Milky Way. The early type KLF has a much flatter slope of (0.14 $\pm$0.02). Our results agree best with an in-situ star formation scenario.

	N2 = {We study the role of massive perturbers (MPs) in deflecting stars and binaries to almost radial (``loss cone'') orbits, where they pass near the central massive black hole (MBH), interact with it at periapse, and are ultimately destroyed. MPs dominate dynamical relaxation when the ratio of the second moments of the MP and star mass distributions, μ2≡Np<M2p>/N*<M2*>, satisfies μ2>>1. We compile the MP mass function from published observations and show that MPs in the nucleus of the Galaxy (mainly giant molecular clouds), and plausibly in late-type galaxies generally, have 102<\~{}μ2<\~{}108. MPs thus shorten the relaxation timescale by 101-107 relative to two-body relaxation by stars alone. We show that this increases by 101-103 the rate of large-periapse interactions with the MBH, where loss cone refilling by stellar two-body relaxation is inefficient. We extend the Fokker-Planck loss cone formalism to approximately account for relaxation by rare encounters with MPs. We show that binary star-MBH exchanges driven by MPs can explain the origin of the young main-sequence B stars that are observed very near the Galactic MBH and can increase by orders of magnitude the ejection rate of hypervelocity stars. In contrast, the rate of small-periapse interactions of single stars with the MBH, such as tidal disruption, is only increased by a factor of a few. We suggest that MP-driven relaxation plays an important role in the three-body exchange capture of stars on very tight orbits around the MBH. These captured stars may later be disrupted by the MBH via tidal orbital decay or direct scattering into the loss cone; captured compact objects may inspiral into the MBH by the emission of gravitational waves from zero-eccentricity orbits.},

O'Leary for pointing this out and T. Oka for clarifying the issue). The corrected observed ratio of second moments of the mass function μ2 in Table 2 should be modified downward to 108 for model GMC1 and to 106 for model GMC2. However, the analytic power-law fit for the mass function that was actually used in the numerical calculations was very conservative to begin with, and still conservatively underestimates μ2 by a factor of 2. Therefore, the results presented in the paper remain unchanged.},

	N2 = {The negligible eccentricity of all extrasolar planets with periods less than 6 days can be accounted for by dissipation of tidal disturbances within their envelopes that are induced by their host stars. In the period range of 7-21 days, planets with circular orbits coexist with planets with eccentric orbits. These are referred to as the borderline planets. We propose that this discrepancy can be attributed to the variation in spin-down rates of young stars. In particular, prior to spin-down, dissipation of a planet's tidal disturbance within the envelope of a sufficiently rapidly spinning star can excite eccentricity growth and, for a more slowly spinning star, at least reduce the eccentricity-damping rate. In contrast, tidal dissipation within the envelope of a slowly spinning low-mass mature star can enhance the eccentricity-damping process. On the basis of these results, we suggest that short-period planets around relatively young stars may have a much larger dispersion in eccentricity than those around mature stars. We also suggest that because the rate of angular momentum loss from G and K dwarfs via stellar winds is much faster than the tidal transfer of angular momentum between themselves and their very short (3-4 days) period planets, they cannot establish a dynamical configuration in which the stellar and planetary spins are approximately parallel and synchronous with the orbital frequency. In principle, however, such configurations may be established for planets (around G and K dwarfs) with orbital periods of up to several weeks. In contrast to G and K dwarfs, the angular momentum loss due to stellar winds is much weaker in F dwarfs. It is therefore possible for synchronized short-period planets to exist around such stars. The planet around Tau Boo is one such example.},

The stars have well-established MK spectral classifications and are mostly restricted to near-solar metallicities. The sample not only contains the F, G, K, and M spectral types with luminosity classes between I and V, but also includes some AGB, carbon, and S stars. In contrast to some other spectral libraries, the continuum shape of the spectra is measured and preserved in the data reduction process. The spectra are absolutely flux calibrated using the Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry. Potential uses of the library include studying the physics of cool stars, classifying and studying embedded young clusters and optically obscured regions of the Galaxy, evolutionary population synthesis to study unresolved stellar populations in optically obscured regions of galaxies and synthetic photometry.

This could explain why small obliquities were observed in the earliest measurements, which focused on relatively cool stars drawn from Doppler surveys, as opposed to hotter stars that emerged more recently from transit surveys. The observed trend could be due to differences in planet formation and migration around stars of varying mass. Alternatively, we speculate that hot-Jupiter systems begin with a wide range of obliquities, but the photospheres of cool stars realign with the orbits due to tidal dissipation in their convective zones, while hot stars cannot realign because of their thinner convective zones. This in turn would suggest that hot Jupiters originate from few-body gravitational dynamics and that disk migration plays at most a supporting role.},

Our analysis leads relatively simply to a closed set of equations, valid for arbitrary inclination of the stellar spin to the orbit. The results are equivalent to classical results based on the rather less clear principle that the tidal bulge lags behind the line of centers by some time determined by the rate of dissipation. Our analysis gives the effective lag time as a function of the dissipation rate and the quadrupole moment. We discuss briefly some possible applications of the formulation.},

We show that the dense stellar cluster around Sgr A* increases by factors of a few the probability of high-magnification lensing events of a distant background source by the black hole. Conversely, the gravitational shear of the black hole changes and enhances the microlensing properties of the individual stars. The effect is largest when the source image lies near the Einstein radius of the black hole (1.75"+/-0.20" for a source at infinity). We estimate that the probability of observing at least one distant background star, which is magnified by a factor greater than 5 in any infrared snapshot of the inner \~{}2" of the Galactic center, is \~{}1{\%} with a K-band detection threshold of 20 mag. The largest source of uncertainty in this estimate is the luminosity function of the background stars. The gravitational shear of the black hole lengthens the duration of high-magnification events near the Einstein radius up to a few months and introduces a large variety of light-curve shapes that are different from those of isolated microlenses. Identification of such events by image subtraction can be used to probe the mass function, density, and velocity distributions of faint stars near the black hole, which are not detectable otherwise.},

Recent Chandra observations suggest that the X-ray emission from this source is partially diffuse. This result provides an important clue that can be used to set some constraints on the mass distribution surrounding the black hole, and we here develop a simple model in which the diffuse emission is produced by a halo of neutron stars accreting from the gas falling toward the center. We discuss the various accretion mechanisms that are likely to contribute significantly to the X-ray flux and show that a highly magnetized fraction of old neutron stars may account for the diffuse high-energy source. If this picture is correct, the upper bound to the mass of the central black hole is \~{}2.2×106 Msolar. The core radius of the dark cluster must then be \~{}0.06 pc. We also discuss the sensitivity of our results to the various assumptions made in our calculations.},

Friction between the magnetosphere and the surrounding plasma is a source of power. In addition, when the magnetic field is asymmetric with respect to the rotation axis of the star, the rotating magnetosphere acts as a propeller, transfering kinetic energy to the material outside the magnetosphere. These processes are qualified and the values of the Alfven radius and of the density of the surrounding plasma are calculated. It is found that, if the neutron star rotates rapidly and has a strong magnetic field, such objects manifest themselves as nonthermal X-ray sources. Otherwise, the material outside the magnetosphere shrouds them in such high optical depth that any outgoing radiation is thermalized. Some observational implications are briefly discussed.},

We propose a new class of sources that accrete via magnetic interaction with the ISM. While for the Bondi mechanism the accretion rate MBondi decreases with increasing neutron star velocity, in magnetic accretors (MAGACs) MMAGAC increases with increasing neutron star velocity (MBondi\~{}v-3 vs. MMAGAC\~{}v1/3). MAGACs will be produced among high-velocity (>\~{}100 km s-1), high magnetic field (B>1014 G) radio pulsars-the ``magnetars''-after they have evolved first through magnetic dipole spin-down, followed by a ``propeller'' phase (during which the object sheds angular momentum on a timescale <\~{}1010 yr). The properties of MAGACs may be summarized thus: dipole magnetic fields of B>\~{}1014 G; minimum velocities relative to the ISM of 25-100 km s-1 or higher, depending on B, well below the median in the observed radio pulsar population; spin periods of greater than days to years; accretion luminosities of 1028-1031 ergs s-1; and effective temperatures kTeff=0.3-2.5 keV if they accrete onto the magnetic polar cap. We find no examples of MAGACs among previously observed source classes (anomalous X-ray pulsars, soft gamma-ray repeaters, or known IONs). However, MAGACs may be more prevalent in flux-limited X-ray catalogs than their gravitationally accreting counterparts.},

In this Letter, we show that the two sets can be brought to excellent agreement with each other when we allow for a small offset in the definition of the reference frame of the two data sets. The required offsets in the coordinates and velocities of the origin of the reference frames are consistent with the uncertainties given in Ghez et al. The so-combined data set allows for a moderate improvement of the statistical errors of the mass of and the distance to Sgr A*, but the overall accuracies of these numbers are dominated by systematic errors and the long-term calibration of the reference frame.

	N2 = {We present the results of 16 years of monitoring stellar orbits around the massive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, using high-resolution near-infrared techniques. This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric accuracy of ≈300 μas, and by investigating in detail the individual systematic error contributions. The combination of a long-time baseline and the excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allows us to determine orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits are fit extremely well by a single-point-mass potential to within the astrometric uncertainties, which are now ≈6×better than in previous studies. The central object mass is (4.31\, \pm\, 0.06{$|$}{\_}\mathrm{\{}stat{\}}\,\pm\, 0.36{$|$}{\_}{\{}R{\_}0{\}})\times 10\^{}6 M{\_}\odot, where the fractional statistical error of 1.5{\%} is nearly independent from R 0, and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R 0. Our current best estimate for the distance to the Galactic center is R 0 = 8.33 $\pm$0.35 kpc. The dominant errors in this value are systematic. The mass scales with distance as (3.95 $\pm$0.06) ×106(R 0/8 kpc)2.19 M sun. The orientations of orbital angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six of the stars with orbital solutions as late-type stars, and six early-type stars as members of the clockwise-rotating disk system, as was previously proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter and apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99{\%} confidence level, of the mass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would expect from other theoretical and observational estimates.},

	N2 = {Resonant relaxation (RR) of orbital angular momenta occurs near massive black holes (MBHs) where the potential is spherical and stellar orbits are nearly Keplerian and so do not precess significantly. The resulting coherent torques efficiently change the magnitude of the angular momenta and rotate the orbital inclination in all directions. As a result, many of the tightly bound stars very near the MBH are rapidly destroyed by falling into the MBH on low angular momentum orbits, while the orbits of the remaining stars are efficiently randomized. We solve numerically the Fokker-Planck equation in energy for the steady state distribution of a single-mass population with an RR sink term. We find that the steady state current of stars, which sustains the accelerated drainage close to the MBH, can be <\~{}10 larger than that due to noncoherent two-body relaxation alone. RR mostly affects tightly bound stars, and so it increases only moderately the total tidal disruption rate, which is dominated by stars originating from less bound orbits farther away. We show that the event rate of gravitational wave (GW) emission from inspiraling stars, originating much closer to the MBH, is dominated by RR dynamics. The GW event rate depends on the uncertain efficiency of RR. The efficiency indicated by the few available simulations implies rates <\~{}10 times higher than those predicted by two-body relaxation, which would improve the prospects of detecting such events by future GW detectors, such as LISA. However, a higher, but still plausible, RR efficiency can lead to the drainage of all tightly bound stars and strong suppression of GW events from inspiraling stars. We apply our results to the Galactic MBH and show that the observed dynamical properties of stars there are consistent with RR.},

	N2 = {We calculate the excitation and dissipation of low-frequency tidal oscillations in uniformly rotating solar-type stars. For tidal frequencies smaller than twice the spin frequency, inertial waves are excited in the convective envelope and are dissipated by turbulent viscosity. Enhanced dissipation occurs over the entire frequency range rather than in a series of very narrow resonant peaks and is relatively insensitive to the effective viscosity. Hough waves are excited at the base of the convective zone and propagate into the radiative interior. We calculate the associated dissipation rate under the assumption that they do not reflect coherently from the center of the star. Tidal dissipation in a model based on the present Sun is significantly enhanced through the inclusion of the Coriolis force but may still fall short of that required to explain the circularization of close binary stars. However, the dependence of the results on the spin frequency, tidal frequency, and stellar model indicate that a more detailed evolutionary study including inertial and Hough waves is required. We also discuss the case of higher tidal frequencies appropriate to stars with very close planetary companions. The survival of even the closest hot Jupiters can be plausibly explained provided that the Hough waves they generate are not damped at the center of the star. We argue that this is the case because the tide excited by a hot Jupiter in the present Sun would marginally fail to achieve nonlinearity. As conditions at the center of the star evolve, nonlinearity may set in at a critical age, resulting in a relatively rapid inspiral of the hot Jupiter.},

	N2 = {We investigate the possibility of substantial inflation of short-period Jupiter-mass planets, as a result of their internal tidal dissipation associated with the synchronization and circularization of their orbits. We employ the simplest prescription based on an equilibrium model with a constant lag angle for all components of the tide. We show the following: (1) In the low-eccentricity limit, the synchronization of the planets' spin with their mean motion is established before tidal dissipation can significantly modify their internal structure. (2) However, above a critical eccentricity, which is a function of the planets' semimajor axis, tidal dissipation of energy during the circularization process can induce planets to inflate in size before their eccentricity is damped. (3) For moderate eccentricities, the planets adjust to stable thermal equilibria in which the rate of their internal tidal dissipation is balanced by the enhanced radiative flux associated with their enlarged radii. (4) For sufficiently large eccentricities, the planets swell beyond two Jupiter radii and their internal degeneracy is partially lifted. Thereafter, their thermal equilibria become unstable and they undergo runaway inflation until their radii exceed the Roche radius. (5) We determine the necessary and sufficient condition for this tidal inflation instability. (6) These results are applied to study short-period planets. We show that for young Jupiter-mass planets, with a period of less than 3 days, an initial radius of about 2RJ, and an orbital eccentricity greater than 0.2, the energy dissipated during the circularization of their orbits is sufficiently intense and protracted to inflate their sizes up to their Roche radii. (7) We estimate the mass-loss rate, the asymptotic planetary masses, and the semimajor axes for various planetary initial orbital parameters. The possibility of gas overflow through both inner (L1) and outer (L2) Lagrangian points for the planets with short periods or large eccentricities is discussed. (8) Planets with more modest eccentricity (<0.3) and semimajor axis (>0.03-0.04 AU) lose mass via Roche lobe overflow mostly through the inner Lagrangian (L1) point. As a result of the conservation of total angular momentum, these mass-losing planets migrate outward, such that their semimajor axes and Roche radii increase while their mass, eccentricity, and tidal dissipation rate decrease until the mass loss is quenched. (9) Based on these results, we suggest that the combined effects of self-regulated mass loss and tidally driven orbital evolution may be responsible for the apparent lack of giant planets with ultrashort periods <\~{}3 days. (10) Mass loss during their orbital circularization may also have caused the planets with periods in the range \~{}3-7 days to be less massive than long-period planets, which are not affected by the star-planet tidal interaction. (11) The accretion of the short-period planets' tidal debris can also lead to the surface layer contamination and metallicity enhancement of their host stars. (12) Among the planets with periods of 1-3 weeks today, some may have migrated outward and attained circular orbits while others may have preserved their initial eccentricity and semimajor axis. Therefore, planets with circular orbits are expected to coexist with those with eccentric orbits in this period range. (13) Gross tidal inflation of planets occurs on the timescale \~{}106 yr after their formation for a brief interval of \~{}105 yr. The relatively large sizes of their classical and weak-line T Tauri host stars increase the planets' transit probability. The inflated sizes of the tidally heated planets also increase the eclipse depth of such transit events. Thus, the tidal inflation and disruption of planets may be directly observable around classical and weak-line T Tauri stars.},

	N2 = {A star that wanders too close to a massive black hole (BH) is shredded by the BH's tidal gravity. Stellar gas falls back to the BH at a rate initially exceeding the Eddington rate, releasing a flare of energy. In anticipation of upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light curves and spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting the unique signatures of tidal flares at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. A reasonable fraction of the gas initially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the fallback rate is super-Eddington at early times. This outflow produces an optical luminosity comparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of \~{}10 d and may have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of galaxies. When the fallback rate subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes onto the BH via a thin disc whose emission peaks in the ultraviolet to soft X-rays. Some of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a spectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden lines). These lines are the strongest for BHs with MBH \~{} 105-106Msolar and thus optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the lowest mass BHs in galactic nuclei. Calibrating our models to ROSAT and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observations, we predict detection rates for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and highlight some of the observational challenges associated with studying tidal disruption events in the optical. Upcoming surveys such as Pan-STARRS should detect at least several events per year, and may detect many more if current models of outflows during super-Eddington accretion are reasonably accurate. These surveys will significantly improve our knowledge of stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei, the physics of super-Eddington accretion, the demography of intermediate mass BHs and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of massive BHs.},

	N2 = {Type Ia supernovae are thought to result from thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars. Existing models generally explain the observed properties, with the exception of the sub-luminous 1991bg-like supernovae. It has long been suspected that the merger of two white dwarfs could give rise to a type Ia event, but hitherto simulations have failed to produce an explosion. Here we report a simulation of the merger of two equal-mass white dwarfs that leads to a sub-luminous explosion, although at the expense of requiring a single common-envelope phase, and component masses of \~{}0.9Msolar. The light curve is too broad, but the synthesized spectra, red colour and low expansion velocities are all close to what is observed for sub-luminous 1991bg-like events. Although the mass ratios can be slightly less than one and still produce a sub-luminous event, the masses have to be in the range 0.83Msolar to 0.9Msolar.},

	N2 = {Theoretical work has shown that intermediate mass (0.01 M \&sun; < M He < 0.1 M \&sun;) helium shells will unstably ignite on the accreting white dwarf (WD) in an AM CVn binary. For more massive (M > 0.8 M \&sun;) WDs, these helium shells can be dense enough (>5 ×105 g cm-3) that the convectively burning region runs away on a timescale comparable to the sound travel time across the shell, raising the possibility for an explosive outcome rather than an Eddington limited helium novae. The nature of the explosion (i.e., deflagration or detonation) remains ambiguous, is certainly density dependent, and likely breaks spherical symmetry. In the case of detonation, this causes a laterally propagating front whose properties in these geometrically thin and low-density shells we begin to study here. Our calculations show that the radial expansion time of <0.1 s leads to incomplete helium burning, in agreement with recent work by Sim and collaborators, but that the nuclear energy released is still adequate to realize a self-sustaining laterally propagating detonation. These detonations are slower than the Chapman-Jouguet speed of 1.5 ×109 cm s-1, but still fast enough at 0.9 ×109 cm s-1 to go around the star prior to the transit through the star of the inwardly propagating weak shock. Our simulations resolve the subsonic region behind the reaction front in the detonation wave. The two-dimensional nucleosynthesis is shown to be consistent with a truncated one-dimensional Zeldovich-von Neumann-D{\"o}ring calculation at the slower detonation speed. The ashes from the lateral detonation are typically He rich, and consist of predominantly 44Ti, 48Cr, along with a small amount of 52Fe, with very little 56Ni and with significant 40Ca in carbon-enriched layers. If this helium detonation results in a Type Ia supernova, its spectral signatures would appear for the first few days after explosion.},

	N2 = {The dynamics of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets during the afterglow phase is most reliably and accurately modeled using hydrodynamic simulations. All published simulations so far, however, have considered only a uniform external medium, while a stratified external medium is expected around long duration GRB progenitors. Here, we present simulations of the dynamics of GRB jets and the resulting afterglow emission for both uniform and stratified external media with ρextvpropr -k for k = 0, 1, 2. The simulations are performed in two dimensions using the special relativistic version of the Mezcal code. Common to all calculations is the initiation of the GRB jet as a conical wedge of half-opening angle θ0 = 0.2 whose radial profile is taken from the self-similar Blandford-McKee solution. The dynamics for stratified external media (k = 1, 2) are broadly similar to those derived for expansion into a uniform external medium (k = 0). The jet half-opening angle is observed to start increasing logarithmically with time (or radius) once the Lorentz factor Γdrops below θ-1 0. For larger k values, however, the lateral expansion is faster at early times (when Γ> θ-1 0) and slower at late times with the jet expansion becoming Newtonian and slowly approaching spherical symmetry over progressively longer timescales. We find that, contrary to analytic expectations, there is a reasonably sharp jet break in the light curve for k = 2 (a wind-like external medium), although the shape of the break is affected more by the viewing angle (for θobs <= θ0) than by the slope of the external density profile (for 0 <= k <= 2). Steeper density profiles (i.e., increasing k values) are found to produce more gradual jet breaks while larger viewing angles cause smoother and later appearing jet breaks. The counterjet becomes visible as it becomes sub-relativistic, and for k = 0 this results in a clear bump-like feature in the light curve. However, for larger k values the jet decelerates more gradually, causing only a mild flattening in the radio light curve that might be hard to discern when k = 2. Late-time radio calorimetry, which makes use of a spherical flow approximation near the non-relativistic transition, is likely to consistently overestimate the true energy by up to a factor of a few for k = 2, but likely to either overpredict or underpredict it by a smaller factor for k = 0, 1.},

	N2 = {We report on the development of Mezcal-SRHD, a new adaptive mesh refinement, special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) code, developed with the aim of studying the highly relativistic flows in gamma-ray burst sources. The SRHD equations are solved using finite-volume conservative solvers, with second-order interpolation in space and time. The correct implementation of the algorithms is verified by one-dimensional (1D) and multi-dimensional tests. The code is then applied to study the propagation of 1D spherical impulsive blast waves expanding in a stratified medium with ρvpropr -k , bridging between the relativistic and Newtonian phases (which are described by the Blandford-McKee and Sedov-Taylor self-similar solutions, respectively), as well as to a two-dimensional (2D) cylindrically symmetric impulsive jet propagating in a constant density medium. It is shown that the deceleration to nonrelativistic speeds in one dimension occurs on scales significantly larger than the Sedov length. This transition is further delayed with respect to the Sedov length as the degree of stratification of the ambient medium is increased. This result, together with the scaling of position, Lorentz factor, and the shock velocity as a function of time and shock radius, is explained here using a simple analytical model based on energy conservation. The method used for calculating the afterglow radiation by post-processing the results of the simulations is described in detail. The light curves computed using the results of 1D numerical simulations during the relativistic stage correctly reproduce those calculated assuming the self-similar Blandford-McKee solution for the evolution of the flow. The jet dynamics from our 2D simulations and the resulting afterglow light curves, including the jet break, are in good agreement with those presented in previous works. Finally, we show how the details of the dynamics critically depend on properly resolving the structure of the relativistic flow.},

For example, magnetized radiative jets from variable sources have been studied with axisymmetric and three-dimensional numerical simulations. In this paper, we present an analytical model describing the effect of a toroidal magnetic field on the internal working surfaces that result from the presence of variability in the ejection velocity. We find that for parameters appropriate to Herbig-Haro jets, the forces associated with the magnetic field dominate over the gas pressure force within the working surfaces. Depending on the ram pressure radial cross section of the jet, the magnetic field can produce a strong axial pinch or, alternatively, a broadening of the internal working surfaces. We check the validity of our analytical model with axisymmetric numerical simulations of variable magnetized jets.},

The chief danger was presented by globally distributed ejecta, including transient thick rock vapor atmospheres. On Earth, much of the thermal radiation is absorbed by boiling the oceans. Any surviving life is either in deep water or well below the surface. Global thermal excursions are buffered by the heat capacity of the oceans. But when impacts are large enough to vaporize the oceans (>1028J), thermal buffering serves only to prolong the disaster for thousands of years, while the oceans rain out. Without oceans, thermal buffering does not occur on Mars. Relatively small impacts (1026J) frequently heat the surface everywhere to the melting point. However, owing to the low Martian escape velocity, the most energetic ejecta (including the rock vapor) more easily escape to space, while massive quantities of less energetic ejecta are globally distributed. Survival in deep subsurface environments is more likely on Mars because (1) Mars' lower background heat flow and lower gravity allow deeper colonies, and (2) the thermal heat pulse from a major impact is briefer. Only thermophile organisms could have survived impacts of asteroids large enough to leave heat or boil the entire terrestrial ocean. Studies of terrestrial microorganisms indicate that the last common ancestor may have been thermophile and the survivor of such a catastrophe. This organism should be distinguished from the first common ancestor. An additional refugium is ejection of rock to space by impacts and their return to a habitable planet.},

The liquid/vapor phase curve and critical point of SiO2 are computed using the equation of state (EOS) program ANEOS. To achieve this goal, two shortcomings of ANEOS are corrected. ANEOS, originally developed at Sandia National Laboratories to describe metals, treats the vapor phase as a monatomic mixture of atoms, rather than molecular clusters. It also assumes a Morse potential for the expanded solid state. Neither of these assumptions is accurate for geologic materials, such as SiO2, that contain molecular clusters in the vapor phase and are better described by a Mie-type potential in the solid state. Using the updates described here, an EOS adequate for numerical hydrocode computations is constructed that agrees well with shock data at pressures up to at least 600 GPa and temperatures up to 50,000 K. This EOS also gives a good representation of the liquid/vapor transition at much lower pressures and temperatures. The estimated critical point parameters for SiO2 are Pc = 0.19 GPa, Tc = 5400K, ρc = 550 kg/m3.},

The sensitivity of the rotation velocity to the various wind model parameters, the initial angular momenta, and the time dependence of the angular velocity for each mass is shown. The theoretical results are compared with observational ones, and it is found that the existence of very rapidly rotating stars in young clusters implies that low-mass stars are formed with a large spread of angular momentum. The high efficiency of angular momentum loss through magnetic stellar winds causes the rotation velocity to become less dependent on initial angular momentum J0 with time; by 300 million yur, the rotation velocity becomes independent of J0. This results in a decrease with time in the spread of rotation velocities as a function of stellar mass in young clusters.},

Thus, the measured rotation rate of a low-mass star provides an estimate of its age when its mass is known. The observed rotation periods of low-mass stars in the Hyades are used to test this conclusion and to check the validity of the theoretical angular momentum loss rates. Adapting the magnetic braking model of Kawaler (1988), the angular momentum loss rate is integrated to derive a relation between rotation period and age, and this relation is converted to a period-age-color relation using simple stellar models. Using this method, a mean rotational age for the Hyades is obtained which is in close agreement with the age determined by isochrone fitting.},

It is found that the tidal forces induce rotation and radial and nonradial pulsations in the star, and that the loss of orbital energy to these internal motions leads to the star's capture by the black hole. While the outer layers of the star are disrupted at small pericenter distances, the entire star is destroyed at even smaller distances.

It is found that all encounters with periastron distance r(p) less than about 2.5 stellar radii R(G) lead to significant disruption of the stellar envelope, including some mass loss. When r(p)/R(G) is less than about 0.5, the envelope is completely destroyed during the collision. About 40 percent of the gas escapes, while the rest forms a massive disk around the compact object, leaving behind the bare stellar core on a highly eccentric orbit. Subsequent close passages lead to continuous extraction of gas from the disk at a large rate, and the binary orbit may eventually stabilize while still retaining a large eccentricity. It is suggested that many globular cluster pulsars may have been spun up by accretion from a massive disk rather than from a binary companion, thereby providing a possible solution to the birthrate problem.},

Analysis of systematic variations in the velocity of the star indicate that the mass of the companion is approximately that of Jupiter, and that it is travelling in a nearly circular orbit at a distance from the star of 0.05 AU (about seven stellar radii). Here we show that, if the companion is indeed a gas-giant planet, it is extremely unlikely to have formed at its present location. We suggest instead that the planet probably formed by gradual accretion of solids and capture of gas at a much larger distance from the star (\~{}5 AU), and that it subsequently migrated inwards through interactions with the remnants of the circumstellar disk. The planet's migration may have stopped in its present orbit as a result of tidal interactions with the star, or through truncation of the inner circumstellar disk by the stellar magnetosphere.},

It is suggested that some fraction of galaxies (particularly dwarf ellipticals) should be extremely bright at far-UV wavelengths if they contain black holes of 1 to 100 million solar masses.

Consequently, though these very hot super-Earths are not characteristic of the overall super-Earth population, their substantial transit probability implies that they should be significant contributors to the full super-Earth population uncovered by Kepler.

There is a thin transition layer between these zones, called the tachocline. This structure has been measured seismologically, but no purely fluid-dynamical mechanism can explain its existence. Here we argue that a self-consistent model requires a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun's interior, as well as consideration of the Coriolis effects in the convection zone and in the tachocline. Turbulent stresses in the convection zone induce (through Coriolis effects) a meridional circulation, causing the gas from the convection zone to burrow downwards, thereby generating the horizontal and vertical shear that characterizes the tachocline. The interior magnetic field stops the burrowing, and confines the shear, as demanded by the observed structure of the tachocline. We outline a dynamical theory of the flow, from which we estimate a field strength of about 10-4 tesla just beneath the tachocline. An important test of this picture, after numerical refinement, will be quantitative consistency between the predicted and observed interior angular velocities.},

	N2 = {We propose a simple interpretation of the rotation period data for solar- and late-type stars. The open cluster and Mount Wilson star observations suggest that rotating stars lie primarily on two sequences, initially called I and C. Some stars lie in the intervening gap. These sequences, and the fractional numbers of stars on each sequence, evolve systematically with cluster age, enabling us to construct crude rotational isochrones allowing ``stellar gyrochronology,'' a procedure, on improvement, likely to yield ages for individual field stars. The age and color dependences of the sequences allow the identification of the underlying mechanism, which appears to be primarily magnetic. The majority of solar- and late-type stars possess a dominant Sun-like, or interface, magnetic field, which connects the convective envelope to both the radiative interior of the star and the exterior, where winds can drain off angular momentum. These stars spin down Skumanich style. An age-decreasing fraction of young G, K, and M stars, which are rapid rotators, possess only a convective field, which is not only inefficient in depleting angular momentum but also incapable of coupling the surface convection zone to the inner radiative zone, so that only the outer zone is spun down, and on an exponential timescale. These stars do not yet possess large-scale dynamos. The large-scale magnetic field associated with the dynamo, apparently created by the shear between the decoupled radiative and convective zones, (re)couples the convective and radiative zones and drives a star from the convective to the interface sequence through the gap on a timescale that increases as stellar mass decreases. Fully convective stars do not possess such an interface, cannot generate an interface dynamo, and hence can never make such a transition. Helioseismic results for the present-day Sun agree with this scheme, which also explains the rotational bimodality observed by Herbst and collaborators among pre-main-sequence stars and the termination of this bimodality when stars become fully convective. This paradigm also provides a new basis for understanding stellar X-ray and chromospheric activity, light-element abundances, and perhaps other stellar phenomena that depend on rotation. This is Paper 13 of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS).},

One significant component of the expression, the dependence on rotation rate, persists from prior work; others do not. The expression has a bifurcation, as before, that corresponds to an observed bifurcation in the rotation periods of coeval open cluster stars. The dual dependencies of this loss rate on stellar mass are captured by two functions, f(B - V) and T(B - V), that can be determined from the rotation period observations. Equivalent masses and other {$[$}UBVRIJHK{$]$} colors are provided in Table 1. Dimensional considerations and a comparison with appropriate calculated quantities suggest interpretations for f and T, both of which appear to be related closely (but differently) to the calculated convective turnover timescale, τc , in cool stars. This identification enables us to write down symmetrical expressions for the angular momentum loss rate and the deceleration of cool stars and also to revive the convective turnover timescale as a vital connection between stellar rotation and stellar activity physics.},

However, many stellar systems are plausibly expected to host black holes, from globular clusters to nuclear star clusters, to massive galaxies. The mere presence of stars in the vicinity of a black hole provides a source of fuel via mass loss of evolved stars. In this paper we assess the expected luminosities of black holes embedded in stellar systems of different sizes and properties, spanning a large range of masses. We model the distribution of stars and derive the amount of gas available to a central black hole through a geometrical model. We estimate the luminosity of the black holes under simple, but physically grounded, assumptions on the accretion flow. Finally we discuss the detectability of {\^a}quiescent{\^a}black holes in the local Universe.},

Particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter (epsilon0) in both relations. We find log(M BH/M sun) = α+ βlog(σ/200 km s-1) with (α, β, epsilon0) = (8.12 $\pm$0.08, 4.24 $\pm$0.41, 0.44 $\pm$0.06) for all galaxies and (α, β, epsilon0) = (8.23 $\pm$0.08, 3.96 $\pm$0.42, 0.31 $\pm$0.06) for ellipticals. The results for ellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatter recovered for spirals is significantly larger. The scatter inferred reinforces the need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass function based on the M-σrelation, and further implies that there may be substantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the M-σrelation. We estimate the M-L relationship as log(M BH/M sun) = α+ βlog(LV /1011 L sun,V ) of (α, β, epsilon0) = (8.95 $\pm$0.11, 1.11 $\pm$0.18, 0.38 $\pm$0.09); using only early-type galaxies. These results appear to be insensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and the distribution of intrinsic scatter. We show that culling the sample according to the resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations to larger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.},

Therefore, these multiple TD events provide a novel method for identifying SMBH binary systems with parsec to subparsec separations. The rates of TDs are investigated using simulations of non-interacting stars initially orbiting a primary SMBH and the potential of the model stellar cusp. The stars are then evolved forward in time and perturbed by a secondary SMBH inspiraling from the edge of the cusp to its stalling radius. We find with conservative magnitude estimates that the next-generation transient survey LSST should detect multiple TDs in approximately three galaxies over five years of observation, though less conservative estimates could increase this rate by an order of magnitude.},

The large spatial scales of moving circulation structures on HD 209458b may generate detectable variability of the planet's atmospheric signatures. In this Letter, we generalize these results to other close-in EGPs, by noting that shallow-water dynamics is essentially specified by the values of the Rossby (Ro) and Burger (Bu) dimensionless numbers. The range of likely values of Ro (\~{}10-2 to 10) and Bu (\~{}1-200) for the atmospheric flow of known close-in EGPs indicates that their circulation should be qualitatively similar to that of HD 209458b. This results mostly from the slow rotation of these tidally synchronized planets.},

Atmospheric circulation models are being developed to study these new regimes but model validations and intercomparisons are needed to establish their consistency and accuracy. To this end, we present a simple Earth-like validation of the pseudospectral solver of meteorological equations called Intermediate General Circulation Model (IGCM), based on Newtonian relaxation to a prescribed latitudinal profile of equilibrium temperatures. We then describe a straightforward and idealized model extension to the atmospheric flow on a hot Jupiter with the same IGCM solver. This shallow, three-dimensional hot Jupiter model is based on Newtonian relaxation to a permanent day-night pattern of equilibrium temperatures and the absence of surface drag. The baroclinic regime1 of the Earth's lower atmosphere is contrasted with the more barotropic regime of the simulated hot Jupiter flow. For plausible conditions at the 0.1-1 bar pressure level on HD 209458b, the simulated flow is characterized by unsteadiness, subsonic wind speeds, a zonally perturbed superrotating equatorial jet and large-scale polar vortices. Violation of the Rayleigh-Kuo inflexion point criterion on the flanks of the accelerating equatorial jet indicates that barotropic (horizontal shear) instabilities may be important dynamical features of the simulated flow. Similarities and differences with previously published simulated hot Jupiter flows are briefly noted.},

We create a mock catalogue of radial velocity data, choosing input planet masses, periods and observing patterns from actual radial velocity surveys and varying input eccentricities. We apply Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations and compare the resulting orbital parameters to the input values. We find that a combination of the effective signal-to-noise ratio of the data, the maximal gap in phase coverage, and the total number of periods covered by observations is a good predictor of the quality of derived orbit parameters. As eccentricity is positive definite, we find that eccentricities of planets on nearly circular orbits are preferentially overestimated, with typical bias of one to two times the median eccentricity uncertainty in a survey (e.g. 0.04 in the Butler et al. catalogue). When performing population analysis, we recommend using the mode of the marginalized posterior eccentricity distribution to minimize potential biases. While the Butler et al. catalogue reports eccentricities below 0.05 for just 17 per cent of single-planet systems, we estimate that the true fraction of e <= 0.05 orbits is about f0.05 = 38 +/- 9 per cent. For planets with P > 10d, we find f0.05 = 28 +/- 8 per cent versus 10 per cent from Butler et al. These planets either never acquired a large eccentricity or were circularized following any significant eccentricity excitation.},

	N2 = {At least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binary stars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation: (1) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the main sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few stellar radii away, and (2) in current theories of planet formation, the region within \~{}0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass planet to form, yet many ``hot Jupiters'' are observed at such distances. We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1-10 days, with a median of \~{}2 days, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 to \~{}105 days), consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40$\,^{\circ}$and 140$\,^{\circ}$. (2) Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star. This work is dedicated to the late Bohdan Paczy{\'n}ski, who inspired it.},

	N2 = {We study the tidal excitation of gravity modes (g-modes) in compact white dwarf binary systems with periods ranging from minutes to hours. As the orbit of the system decays via gravitational radiation, the orbital frequency increases and sweeps through a series of resonances with the g-modes of the white dwarf. At each resonance, the tidal force excites the g-mode to a relatively large amplitude, transferring the orbital energy to the stellar oscillation. We calculate the eigenfrequencies of g-modes and their coupling coefficients with the tidal field for realistic non-rotating white dwarf models. Using these mode properties, we numerically compute the excited mode amplitude in the linear approximation as the orbit passes though the resonance, including the backreaction of the mode on the orbit. We also derive analytical estimates for the mode amplitude and the duration of the resonance, which accurately reproduce our numerical results for most binary parameters. We find that the g-modes can be excited to a dimensionless (mass-weighted) amplitude up to 0.1, with the mode energy approaching {\$}10\^{}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} of the gravitational binding energy of the star. This suggests that thousands of years prior to the binary merger, the white dwarf may be heated up significantly by tidal interactions. However, more study is needed since the physical amplitudes of the excited oscillation modes become highly nonlinear in the outer layer of the star, which can reduce the mode amplitude attained by tidal excitation.},

In contrast to two-body relaxation, where interactions between stars are incoherent, the resulting resonant relaxation (RR) process is characterized by coherence times of hundreds of orbital periods. In this paper, we show that all the statistical properties of RR can be reproduced in an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. We use the ARMA model, calibrated with extensive N-body simulations, to analyze the long-term evolution of stellar systems around MBHs with Monte Carlo simulations. We show that for a single-mass system in steady state, a depression is carved out near an MBH as a result of tidal disruptions. Using Galactic center parameters, the extent of the depression is about 0.1 pc, of similar order to but less than the size of the observed "hole" in the distribution of bright late-type stars. We also find that the velocity vectors of stars around an MBH are locally not isotropic. In a second application, we evolve the highly eccentric orbits that result from the tidal disruption of binary stars, which are considered to be plausible precursors of the "S-stars" in the Galactic center. We find that RR predicts more highly eccentric (e > 0.9) S-star orbits than have been observed to date.},

The behavior of hydrogen, helium, water, iron, rock, and other materials during the evolution of planetary interiors is addressed. Models of heat flow and gravitational potentials are used to demonstrate the probable characteristics of planetary interiors. The roles of rapidly rotating Maclaurin spheroids, hydrostatic equilibrium, tidal torques, and tidal heating in planetary structures are explained. The mechanisms of heat transport, planetary energy sources and their distribution, characteristics of planetary magnetism, and differences between terrestrial and Jovian planets are discussed.},

	N2 = {In the sequential accretion model, planets form through the sedimentation of dust, cohesive collisions of planetesimals, and coagulation of protoplanetary embryos prior to the onset of efficient gas accretion. As progenitors of terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giant planets, embryos have comparable masses and are separated by the full width of their feeding zones after the oligarchic growth. Within this context, we investigate the orbit-crossing time (Tc) of protoplanetary systems with equal planetary masses and initial separation k0 scaled by their mutual Hill radii (``EMS systems''). In a gas-free environment, log{$[$}Tc/(1 yr){$]$} \~{}= A+Blog(k0/2.3), where A and B are functions of the planetary masses and initial eccentricities. This power law is caused by a random-walk diffusion of velocity dispersion σ(t) in the EMS systems. The diffusion also leads to (1) a Rayleigh distribution of eccentricities with probability P(t)=(e/σ2)exp{$[$}-e2/(2σ2){$]$} at time t and (2) an evolution of average eccentricity \~{}t1/2. As evidence of this chaotic diffusion, the observed eccentricities of known extrasolar planets obey a Rayleigh distribution. In a gaseous environment, as embryos become well separated (with k0\~{}=6-12), their orbit-crossing tendency is suppressed by tidal drag, and their growth is stalled as their orbits are circularized. We evaluate the isolation masses of the embryos, which determine the probability of gas giant formation, as a function of the dust and gas surface densities.},

	N2 = {When a planet falls onto the surface of its host star, the added high-metallicity material does not remain in the surface layers, as often assumed, but is diluted into the interior through fingering (thermohaline) convection. Until now, however, the timescale over which this process happens remained very poorly constrained. Using recently-measured turbulent mixing rates for fingering convection, I provide reliable numerical and semi-analytical estimates for the rate at which the added heavy elements drain into the interior. I find that the relative metallicity enhancement post-infall drops by a factor of ten over a timescale which depends only on the structure of the host star, and decreases very rapidly with increasing stellar mass (from about 1Gyr for a 1.3M{\_}sun star to 10Myr for a 1.5M{\_}sun star). This result offers an elegant explanation to the lack of observed trend between metallicity and convection zone mass in planet-bearing stars. More crucially, it strongly suggests that the statistically-higher metallicity of planet-bearing stars must be of primordial origin. Finally, the fingering region is found to extend deeply into the star, a result which would provide a simple theoretical explanation to the measurements of higher lithium depletion rates in planet-bearing stars.},

This process has been given relatively little attention so far, and its properties remain poorly constrained. In this paper, we present and analyze a set of three-dimensional simulations of this phenomenon in a Cartesian domain under the Boussinesq approximation. We find that in some cases the double-diffusive convection saturates into a state of homogeneous turbulence, but with turbulent fluxes several orders of magnitude smaller than those expected from direct overturning convection. In other cases, the system rapidly and spontaneously develops closely packed thermo-compositional layers, which later successively merge until a single layer is left. We compare the output of our simulations with an existing theory of layer formation in the oceanographic context and find very good agreement between the model and our results. The thermal and compositional mixing rates increase significantly during layer formation and increase even further with each merger. We find that the heat flux through the staircase is a simple function of the layer height. We conclude by proposing a new approach to studying transport by double-diffusive convection in astrophysics.},

	N2 = {The discovery of Jupiter-mass planets in close orbits about their parent stars has challenged models of planet formation. Recent observations have shown that a number of these planets have highly inclined, sometimes retrograde orbits about their parent stars, prompting much speculation as to their origin. It is known that migration alone cannot account for the observed population of these misaligned hot Jupiters, which suggests that dynamical processes after the gas disk dissipates play a substantial role in yielding the observed inclination and eccentricity distributions. One particularly promising candidate is planet-planet scattering, which is not very well understood in the nonlinear regime of tides. Through three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of multi-orbit encounters, we show that planets that are scattered into an orbit about their parent stars with closest approach distance being less than approximately three times the tidal radius are either destroyed or completely ejected from the system. We find that as few as 9 and as many as 12 of the currently known hot Jupiters have a maximum initial apastron for scattering that lies well within the ice line, implying that these planets must have migrated either before or after the scattering event that brought them to their current positions. If stellar tides are unimportant (Q * >\~{} 107), disk migration is required to explain the existence of the hot Jupiters present in these systems. Additionally, we find that the disruption and/or ejection of Jupiter-mass planets deposits a Sun's worth of angular momentum onto the host star. For systems in which planet-planet scattering is common, we predict that planetary hosts have up to a 35{\%} chance of possessing an obliquity relative to the invariable plane of greater than 90$\,^{\circ}$.},

	N2 = {We study the chaotic orbital evolution of planetary systems, focusing on secular (i.e., orbit-averaged) interactions, because these often dominate on long timescales. We first focus on the evolution of a test particle that is forced by multiple massive planets. To linear order in eccentricity and inclination, its orbit precesses with constant frequencies. But nonlinearities can shift the frequencies into and out of secular resonance with the planets' eigenfrequencies, or with linear combinations of those frequencies. The overlap of these nonlinear secular resonances drive secular chaos in planetary systems. We quantify the resulting dynamics for the first time by calculating the locations and widths of nonlinear secular resonances. When results from both analytical calculations and numerical integrations are displayed together in a newly developed "map of the mean momenta" (MMM), the agreement is excellent. This map is particularly revealing for non-coplanar planetary systems and demonstrates graphically that chaos emerges from overlapping secular resonances. We then apply this newfound understanding to Mercury. Previous numerical simulations have established that Mercury's orbit is chaotic, and that Mercury might even collide with Venus or the Sun. We show that Mercury's chaos is primarily caused by the overlap between resonances that are combinations of four modes, the Jupiter-dominated eccentricity mode, the Venus-dominated inclination mode and Mercury's free eccentricity and inclination. Numerical integration of the Solar system confirms that a slew of these resonant angles alternately librate and circulate. We are able to calculate the threshold for Mercury to become chaotic: Jupiter and Venus must have eccentricity and inclination of a few percent. Mercury appears to be perched on the threshold for chaos.},

	N2 = {Double white dwarfs (WDs) are expected to be a source of confusion-limited noise for the future gravitational wave observatory LISA. In a specific frequency range, this "foreground noise" is predicted to rise above the instrumental noise and hinder the detection of other types of signals, e.g., gravitational waves arising from stellar-mass objects inspiraling into massive black holes. In many previous studies, only detached populations of compact object binaries have been considered in estimating the LISA gravitational wave foreground signal. Here, we investigate the influence of compact object detached and Roche-Lobe overflow (RLOF) Galactic binaries on the shape and strength of the LISA signal. Since >99{\%} of remnant binaries that have orbital periods within the LISA sensitivity range are WD binaries, we consider only these binaries when calculating the LISA signal. We find that the contribution of RLOF binaries to the foreground noise is negligible at low frequencies, but becomes significant at higher frequencies, pushing the frequency at which the foreground noise drops below the instrumental noise to >6 mHz. We find that it is important to consider the population of mass-transferring binaries in order to obtain an accurate assessment of the foreground noise on the LISA data stream. However, we estimate that there still exists a sizeable number (\~{}11,300) of Galactic double WD binaries that will have a signal-to-noise ratio >5, and thus will be potentially resolvable with LISA. We present the LISA gravitational wave signal from the Galactic population of WD binaries, show the most important formation channels contributing to the LISA disk and bulge populations, and discuss the implications of these new findings.},

By observing the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect we show that WASP-19b's orbit is aligned, with λ= 4fdg6 $\pm$5fdg2. Using, in addition, a spectroscopic vsin I and the observed rotation period we conclude that the obliquity, ψ, is less than 20$\,^{\circ}$. Further, the eccentricity of the orbit is less than 0.02. We argue that hot Jupiters with orbital periods as short as that of WASP-19b are two orders of magnitude less common than hot Jupiters at the 3-4 day "pileup." We discuss the evolution of WASP-19b's orbit and argue that most likely it was first moved to near twice the Roche limit by third-body interactions, and has since spiralled inward to its current location under tidal decay. This is compatible with a stellar tidal-dissipation quality factor, Q'*, of order 107.},

	N2 = {We have developed a massively parallel, simple and fast hydrodynamics code for multidimensional, self-gravitating and adiabatic flows. Our primary motivation is the study of the non-linear development of white dwarf oscillations excited via tidal resonances, typically over hundreds of stellar dynamical times. Consequently, we require long-term stability, low diffusivity and high-numerical efficiency. This is accomplished by an Eulerian finite-difference scheme on a regular Cartesian grid. This choice of coordinates provides uniform resolution throughout the flow as well as simplifying the computation of the self-gravitational potential, which is done via spectral methods. In this paper, we describe the numerical scheme and present the results of some common diagnostic problems. We also demonstrate the stability of a cold white dwarf in three dimensions over hundreds of dynamical times. Finally, we compare the results of the numerical scheme to the linear theory of adiabatic oscillations, finding numerical quality factors on the order of 6000 and excellent agreement with the oscillation frequency obtained by the linear analysis.},

The resulting evolutionary sequences show a clear tendency towards inflated radii for effective temperatures that give rise to significant ionization of alkali metals in the atmosphere, compatible with the trend of the data. The degree of inflation shows that Ohmic dissipation, along with the likely variability in heavy element content can universally explain all of the currently detected radius anomalies. Furthermore, we find that in absence of a massive core, low-mass hot Jupiters can over-flow their Roche-lobes and evaporate on Gyr time-scales, possibly leaving behind small rocky cores.},

For interactions with general equations of state and material interfaces, a new generalized Roe average is proposed. For single-phase interactions, this new Roe average does not introduce artificial states and satisfies the U-property exactly. For interactions at material interfaces, the U-property is satisfied by introducing ghost states for the internal energy. A number of numerical tests suggest that the proposed Riemann solver is suitable for general equations of state and has an accuracy comparable to iterative Riemann solvers, while being significantly more robust and efficient.},

	N2 = {We study the fate of internal gravity waves approaching the centre of a non-rotating solar-type star, by performing 3D numerical simulations using a Boussinesq-type model. These waves are excited at the top of the radiation zone by the tidal forcing of a short-period planet on a circular, coplanar orbit. This extends previous work done in 2D by Barker \& Ogilvie. We first derive a linear wave solution, which is not exact in 3D; however, the reflection of ingoing waves from the centre is close to perfect for moderate amplitude waves. Waves with sufficient amplitude to cause isentropic overturning break, and deposit their angular momentum near the centre. This forms a critical layer, at which the angular velocity of the flow matches the orbital angular frequency of the planet. This efficiently absorbs ingoing waves, and spins up the star from the inside out, while the planet spirals into the star. We also perform numerical integrations to determine the linearised adiabatic tidal response throughout the star, for solar-type stellar models with masses in the range 0.5 < m{\_}star/M{\_}sun < 1.1, throughout their main sequence lifetimes. The aim is to study the launching region for these waves at the top of the radiation zone in more detail, and to determine the accuracy of a semi-analytic approximation for the tidal torque on the star, that was derived under the assumption that all ingoing wave angular momentum is absorbed in a critical layer. The main conclusions are that this nonlinear mechanism of tidal dissipation could provide an explanation for the survival of all short-period extrasolar planets observed around FGK stars, while it predicts the destruction of more massive planets. This work provides further support for the model outlined in a previous paper by Barker \& Ogilvie, and makes predictions that will be tested by ongoing observational studies, such as WASP and Kepler.},

	N2 = {We present the results of a systematic numerical study of the onset of mass transfer in double degenerate binary systems and its impact on the subsequent evolution. All investigated systems belong to the regime of direct impact, unstable mass transfer. In all of the investigated cases, even those considered unstable by conventional stability analysis, we find a long-lived mass transfer phase continuing for as many as several dozen orbital periods. This settles a recent debate sparked by a discrepancy between earlier smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations that showed disruptions after a few orbital periods and newer grid-based studies in which mass transfer continued for tens of orbits. The number of orbits a binary survives sensitively depends on the exact initial conditions. We find that the approximate initial conditions that have been used in most previous SPH calculations have a serious impact on all stages of the evolution from the onset of mass transfer up to the final structure of the remnant. We compare "approximate" initial conditions where spherical stars are placed at an initial separation obtained from an estimate of the Roche lobe size with "accurate" initial conditions that were constructed by carefully driving the binary system to equilibrium by a relaxation scheme. Simulations that use the approximate initial conditions underestimate the initial separation when mass transfer sets in, which yields a binary that only survives for only a few orbits and thus a rapidly fading gravitational wave signal. Conversely, the accurate initial conditions produce a binary system in which the mass transfer phase is extended by almost two orders of magnitude in time, resulting in a gravitational wave signal with amplitude and frequency that remain essentially constant up until merger. As we show that these binaries can survive at small separation for hundreds of orbital periods, their associated gravitational wave signal should be included when calculating the gravitational wave foreground (although expected to be below Laser Interferometer Space Antenna's sensitivity at these high frequencies). We also show that the inclusion of the entropy increase associated with shock heating of the accreted material reduces the number of orbits a binary survives given the same initial conditions, although the effect is not as pronounced when using the appropriate initial conditions. The use of accurate initial conditions and a correct treatment of shock heating allows for a reliable time evolution of the temperature, density, and angular momentum, which are important when considering thermonuclear events that may occur during the mass transfer phase and/or after merger. Our treatment allows us to accurately identify when surface detonations may occur in the lead-up to the merger, as well as the properties of final merger products.},

	N2 = {The hydrodynamics of the implosion and rebound of a small (10 μm diameter) air bubble in water was studied using a three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS). To study this problem, we developed a novel stabilized finite element method (FEM) employing a combination of ghost fluid and level set approaches. This formulation treats both the air and water as compressible fluids. Using this method, a transient three-dimensional (3-D) solution was obtained for the implosion (i.e., collapse) and rebound of an air bubble. These simulation results obtained were qualitatively similar to those observed/predicted in previous experimental/numerical studies. The 3-D simulations show that the conditions within the bubble are nearly uniform until the converging pressure wave is strong enough to create very large temperatures and pressures near the center of the bubble. These dynamics occur on very small spatial (0.1 0.7 μm), and time (ns) scales. The motion of the air/water interface during the initial stages of the implosion was found to be consistent with predictions using a Rayleigh Plesset model. However, the simulations showed that during the final stage of energetic implosions, the bubble can become asymmetric, which is contrary to the spherical symmetry assumed in many previous numerical studies of bubble dynamics. The direct numerical simulations predicted two different instabilities, namely Rayleigh Taylor type interfacial/surface and shape instabilities. During the violent collapse stage, the bubble deviates from spherical symmetry and deforms into an ellipsoidal-shaped bubble. A linear stability analysis based on spherical harmonics also indicates that an ellipsoidal bubble shape could be expected. Moreover, interfacial instabilities also appear during the later stage of the implosion process. Distinguishing these phenomena with the help of numerical simulations opens new opportunities to understand many features of recent experiments on sonoluminescence and sonofusion.},

The superior capabilities of this method as compared to previously published methods stem from the fact that the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and Poisson's equation are solved simultaneously with a Newton-Raphson iteration scheme. To demonstrate the capabilities of the method the authors have computed equilibrium sequences of differentially rotating polytropes for several rotation laws, and one equilibrium sequence using the ideal Fermi gas equation of state. Although in these examples the pressure is a function of the density only, a simple extension of the method allows to model closely more realistic temperature-dependent equations of state.},

At these and greater densities, the self-supporting detonation wave is of the pathological type. For such waves the detonation speed is an eigenvalue of the steady equations, and the reaction zone contains an internal frozen sonic point where the thermicity vanishes. The self-supporting flow downstream of this singular point is supersonic, and is very different from that in supported (overdriven) detonations. A method for determining the structure of pathological detonation waves is described. These waves are examined, and the self-sustaining wave is compared with and contrasted to the supported detonations considered previously by Khokhlov. We show that the thickness of the self-sustaining detonation is a few times the thickness of supported detonations, and that the self-sustaining detonation produces more of the iron-peak and less of the intermediate mass elements than do supported detonations. Implications for the cellular detonation instability are also discussed.},

Using the most recent calculations of accretion onto white dwarfs, we consider SN Ia explosions of various white dwarfs in binary systems. We calculate the evolutionary delay times from the zero-age main sequence to the explosion and verify which scenarios can satisfy the constraints found by Strolger et al., i.e., a delay time of 2-4 Gyr. It is found that the semidetached double white dwarf binary model is inconsistent with observations. Only SN Ia progenitors in the double-degenerate scenario are compatible with observations in all tested evolutionary models, with a characteristic delay time of \~{}3 Gyr. If double-degenerate mergers are excluded as SN Ia progenitors, we find that the single-degenerate scenario may explain the observed delay times for models with low common-envelope efficiency. It is also noted that the delay time distributions within the various tested SN Ia scenarios vary significantly and can potentially be used as an additional constraint on progenitor models.},

Special emphasis is placed here on processes leading to the formation and further evolution of compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes). Both single and binary star populations are considered. The code now incorporates detailed calculations of all mass transfer phases, a full implementation of orbital evolution due to tides, as well as the most recent estimates of magnetic braking. This updated version of StarTrack can be used for a wide variety of problems, with relevance to observations with many current and planned observatories, e.g., studies of X-ray binaries (Chandra, XMM-Newton), gravitational radiation sources (LIGO, LISA), and gamma-ray burst progenitors (HETE-II, Swift). The code has already been used in studies of Galactic and extragalactic X-ray binary populations, black holes in young star clusters, Type Ia supernova progenitors, and double compact object populations. Here we describe in detail the input physics, we present the code calibration and tests, and we outline our current studies in the context of X-ray binary populations.},

The sequence of double white dwarfs divides naturally into three segments: (1) low-mass helium/helium pairs are unstable to dynamical time-scale mass transfer and probably coalesce to form helium-burning sdO stars; (2) in helium/carbon-oxygen pairs, mass transfer occurs on the time scale for gravitational radiation losses; the accreted helium is quickly ignited, and the accretor expands to dimensions characteristic of R CrB stars, engulfing its companion star; and (3) carbon-oxygen/carbon-oxygen pairs are again unstable to dynamical time-scale mass transfer and, since their total masses exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, are destined to become supernovae. Inactive lifetimes in these latter systems between creation and interaction can exceed 10 billion years. Birthrates of R CrB stars and Type I supernovae by evolution of double white dwarfs are in reasonable agreement with observational estimates.},

The discussion is limited to systems consisting of carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon-magnesium dwarfs and those composed of two carbon-oxygen dwarfs. The companions spiral together and the secondary, with a mass more than about 0.6 solar mass, fills its Roche lobe. The radius of the secondary increases faster than the Roche lobe due to mass overflow, which becomes unstable. The instability can lead to a Type I explosion and may or may not cause the formation of a neutron star. If a neutron star forms, the secondary, reduced to below 0.6 solar mass, will spiral inward to the primary and eventually be absorbed by the neutron star. If a white dwarf remnant remains after the supernova explosion of the overflow radius, then a second supernova explosion can occur.},

With only minor modifications, this method can also be applied to describe contact discontinuities. Two different implementations are described and their physically correct behaviour for simple testcases is shown.

They cover the range 2.10 <log T(K) < 7.06 and 4 <log P (dyn cm-2) < 19 and include new physical treatments of partial dissociation and ionization caused by both pressure and temperature effects. The hydrogen EOS is based on a careful study of nonideal interactions. In the case of helium, the principal features of the EOS physics are retained in a simplified model. The calculation is based on the free energy,minimization method, and a detailed account of the physical model has been published elsewhere. Mixtures of hydrogen and helium are obtained with the additive volume rule and an additional ideal entropy-of-mixing term. In this paper, we present extensive tabular results for both the H and He EOS, together with a critical analysis. Part of this analysis is based on a comparison with other EOS commonly used in astrophysics. Both EOS everywhere satisfy the requirements of thermal and mechanical stability and are thermodynamically consistent over most of the phase diagram. A complete set of the tables is available in the AAS CD-ROM Series, Vol. 5, and by anonymous FTP.},

	N2 = {We present the discovery and characterization of PTF10iya, a short-lived (Δt≈10 d, with an optical decay rate of ˜0.3 mag d-1), luminous (? mag) transient source found by the Palomar Transient Factory. The ultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fitted by a blackbody with T≈(1-2) ×104 K and peak bolometric luminosity LBB≈(1-5) ×1044 erg s-1 (depending on the details of the extinction correction). A comparable amount of energy is radiated in the X-ray band that appears to result from a distinct physical process. The location of PTF10iya is consistent with the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z= 0.224 05 $\pm$0.000 06) to within 350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than 1.2 kpc. At first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of the characteristic 'big blue bump' seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of many active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, emission-line diagnostics of the host galaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show no evidence for AGN-like activity. We therefore consider whether the tidal disruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole may account for our observations. Though with limited temporal information, PTF10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early 'super-Eddington' phase of a solar-type star being disrupted by a ˜107 M\&sun; black hole. Regardless of the precise physical origin of the accreting material, the large luminosity and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxies can transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the Eddington limit; many such outbursts may have been missed by previous surveys lacking sufficient cadence.},

In this paper we report the second candidate tidal disruption event discovery in the UV by the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey and present simultaneous optical light curves from the CFHTLS Deep Imaging Survey for both UV flares. The first few months of the UV/optical light curves are well fitted with the canonical t-5/3 power-law decay predicted for emission from the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted star. Chandra ACIS X-ray observations during the flares detect soft X-ray sources with Tbb=(2-5)×105 K or Γ>3 and place limits on hard X-ray emission from an underlying AGN down to LX(2-10 keV)<\~{}1041 ergs s-1. Blackbody fits to the UV/optical spectral energy distributions of the flares indicate peak flare luminosities of >\~{}1044-1045 ergs s-1. The temperature, luminosity, and light curves of both flares are in excellent agreement with emission from a tidally disrupted main-sequence star onto a central black hole of several times 107 Msolar. The observed detection rate of our search over \~{}2.9 deg 2 of GALEX Deep Imaging Survey data spanning from 2003 to 2007 is consistent with tidal disruption rates calculated from dynamical models, and we use these models to make predictions for the detection rates of the next generation of optical synoptic surveys.

Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Since common active galactic nuclei have accreting black holes that can also produce flares, a convincing demonstration that a stellar tidal disruption has occurred generally begins with a ``normal'' galaxy that has no evidence of prior nuclear activity. Here we report a luminous UV flare from an elliptical galaxy at z=0.37 in the Groth field of the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey that has no evidence of a Seyfert nucleus from optical spectroscopy and X-ray imaging obtained during the flare. Multiwavelength data collected at the time of the event, and for 2 years following, allow us to constrain, for the first time, the spectral energy distribution of a candidate tidal disruption flare from optical through X-rays. The luminosity and temperature of the radiation and the decay curve of the flare are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for the tidal disruption of a star, and provide the strongest empirical evidence for a stellar disruption event to date.},

We examine the first results of an ongoing archival survey of galaxy clusters using Chandra and XMM-Newton-selected data and report a likely tidal disruption flare from SDSS J131122.15-012345.6 in A1689. The flare is observed to vary by a factor of gsim30 over at least two years to have maximum LX (0.3-3.0 keV) >\~{} 5 ×1042 erg s-1 and to emit as a blackbody with kT \~{} 0.12 keV. From the galaxy population as determined by existing studies of the cluster, we estimate a tidal disruption rate of 1.2 ×10-4 galaxy-1 yr-1 if we assume a contribution to the observable rate from galaxies whose range of luminosities corresponds to a central black hole mass (M *) between 106 and 108 M sun.},

The paradigm that the nuclei of inactive galaxies are also occupied by black holes was predicted long ago by theory. In the past decade, this conjecture was confirmed by the discovery of giant-amplitude, non-recurrent X-ray flares from such inactive galaxies and explained in terms of outburst radiation from stars tidally disrupted by a dormant supermassive black hole at the nuclei of those galaxies. Aims: Due to the scarcity of detected tidal disruption events, the confirmation and follow-up of each new candidate is needed to strengthen the theory through observational data, as well as to shed new light on the characteristics of this type of events. Methods: Two tidal disruption candidates have been detected with XMM-Newton during slew observations. Optical and X-ray follow-up, post-outburst observations were performed on these highly variable objects in order to further study their classification and temporal evolution. Results: We show that the detected low-state X-ray emission for these two candidates has properties such that it must still be related to the flare. The X-ray luminosity of the objects decreases according to theoretical predictions for tidal disruption events. At present, optical spectra of the sources do not present any evident signature of the disruption event. In addition, the tidal disruption rate as derived from the XMM-Newton slew survey has been computed and agrees with previous studies.},

The most plausible scenario of these unusual phenomena is tidal disruption of a star by a quiescent supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy. Aims: Only a small number of these type of events have been observed and confirmed to date. The discovery of more cases would allow a number of fundamental conclusions to be drawn about properties such as the frequency of tidal disruption events, the distribution of quiescent black hole masses and their influence in the context of galaxy/AGN formation and evolution among others. Methods: Comparing the XMM-Newton Slew Survey Source Catalogue with the ROSAT PSPC All-Sky Survey five galaxies have been detected a factor of up to 88 brighter in XMM-Newton with respect to ROSAT PSPC upper limits and presenting a soft X-ray colour. X-ray luminosities of these sources derived from slew observations have been found in the range 1041{\{}-{\}}1044 erg s-1, fully consistent with the tidal disruption model. This model predicts that during the peak of the outburst, flares reach X-ray luminosities up to 1045 erg s-1, which is close to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, and afterwards a decay of the flux on a time scale of months to years is expected. Multi-wavelength follow-up observations have been performed on these highly variable objects in order to disentangle their nature and to investigate their dynamical evolution. Results: Here we present sources coming from the XMM-Newton Slew Survey that could fit in the paradigm of tidal disruption events. X-ray and optical observations revealed that two of these objects are in full agreement with that scenario and three other sources that, showing signs of optical activity, need further investigation within the transient galactic nuclei phenomena.},

These outbursts may result from the tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes, as well as accretion disk instabilities. In order to place the first reliable constraints on the rate of such outbursts in the universe and to test the stellar tidal disruption hypothesis, we have performed a systematic and complete survey for them by cross-correlating ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) and pointed Position Sensitive Proportional Counter data. We have detected five galaxies that were in outburst during the RASS, three of which show no signs of nuclear activity; these objects had been reported on individually in previous studies. After making reasonable corrections for the complicated selection effects, we conclude that the rate of large-amplitude X-ray outbursts from inactive galaxies in the local universe is \~{}9.1×10-6 galaxy-1 yr-1. This rate is consistent with the predicted rate of stellar tidal disruption events in such galaxies. When only the two active galaxies are considered, we find a rate for active galaxies of \~{}8.5×10-4 galaxy-1 yr-1. In order to place tighter constraints on these rates, additional outbursts must be detected.},

The soft X-ray properties of the nucleus of NGC 5905 derived from the RASS observations, namely high-amplitude flux variability on timescales of days, the extremely soft spectrum (photon index {\{}GAMMA{\}}=4), and high peak luminosity of L{\_}X{\_}=7x10\^{}42\^{}ergs/s, are all inconsistent with its optical classification as HII-type, i.e. starburst galaxy. During the pointed observations taken two years later, the X-ray luminosity was down by a factor of >80. Possible mechanisms, which can produce the high state, are discussed. Tidal disruption of a star near a central black hole is in good agreement with the observations.},

In the local universe, we use the wide-area surveys from the Swift and INTEGRAL satellites, while for high redshifts we explore candidate selections based on a combination of X-ray and mid-infrared (mid-IR) parameters. We find a significantly lower space density of CT AGNs in the local universe than expected from published AGN population synthesis models to explain the X-ray background (XRB). This can be explained by the numerous degeneracies in the parameters of those models; we use the high-energy surveys described here to remove those degeneracies. We show that only direct observations of CT AGNs can currently constrain the number of heavily obscured supermassive black holes. At high redshift, the inclusion of IR-selected CT AGN candidates leads to a much higher space density, implying (1) a different (steeper) evolution for these sources compared to less-obscured AGNs, (2) that the IR selection includes a large number of interlopers, and/or (3) that there is a large number of reflection-dominated AGNs missed in the INTEGRAL and Swift observations. The contribution of CT AGN to the XRB is small, \~{}9{\%}, with a comparable contribution to the total cosmic accretion, unless reflection-dominated CT AGNs significantly outnumber transmission-dominated CT AGNs, in which case their contribution can be much higher. Using estimates derived here for the accretion luminosity over cosmic time, we estimate the local mass density in supermassive black holes and find a good agreement with available constraints for an accretion efficiency of \~{}10{\%}. Transmission-dominated CT AGNs contribute only \~{}8{\%} to total black hole growth.},

If detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs following a detonation in an accumulated layer of helium on the white dwarf's surface ('double-detonation' models) are able to produce thermonuclear explosions which are characteristically similar to those of SNe Ia, then these sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions may account for at least some substantial fraction of the observed SN Ia rate. Regardless of whether all double-detonations look like 'normal' SNe Ia, in any case the explosions are expected to be bright and thus potentially detectable. Additionally, we find that the delay time distribution of double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia can be divided into two distinct formation channels: the 'prompt' helium-star channel with delay times <500 Myr (13 per cent of all sub-Chandras), and the 'delayed' double white dwarf channel, with delay times ≳800 Myr spanning up to a Hubble time (87 per cent). These findings coincide with recent observationally derived delay time distributions which have revealed that a large number of SNe Ia are prompt with delay times <500 Myr, while a significant fraction also have delay times spanning ˜1 Gyr to a Hubble time.},

	N2 = {Proper motions and radial velocities of luminous infrared stars in the Galactic center have provided strong evidence for a dark mass of 2.5x10\^{}6 M{\_}solar in the central 0.05 pc of the Galaxy. The leading hypothesis for this mass is a black hole. High angular resolution measurements at radio wavelengths find a compact radio source, Sagittarius (Sgr) A*, that is either the faint glow from a small amount of material accreting onto the hole with low radiative efficiency or a miniature active galactic nucleus (AGN) core-jet system. This paper provides a full report on the first program that has measured the apparent proper motion of Sgr A* with respect to background extragalactic reference frame. Our current result is μ{\_}l,*={$[$}-6.18+/-0.19{$]$} mas yr\^{}-1 μ{\_}b,*={$[$}-0.65+/-0.17{$]$} mas yr\^{}-1 The observations were obtained with the NRAO Very Large Array at 4.9 GHz over 16 yr. The proper motion of Sgr A* provides an estimate of its mass based on equipartition of kinetic energy between the hole and the surrounding stars. The measured motion is largest in galactic longitude. This component of the motion is consistent with the secular parallax that results from the rotation of the solar system about the center, which is a global measure of the difference between Oort's constants (A-B), with no additional peculiar motion of Sgr A*. The current uncertainty in Oort's galactic rotation constants limits the use of this component of the proper motion for a mass inference. In latitude, we find a small, and weakly significant, peculiar motion of Sgr A*, -19+/-7 km s\^{}-1 after correction for the motion of the solar system with respect to the local standard of rest. We consider sources of peculiar motion of Sgr A* ranging from unstable radio wave propagation through intervening turbulent plasma to the effects of asymmetric masses in the center. These fail to account for a significant peculiar motion. One can appeal to an m=1 dynamical instability that numerical simulations have revealed. However, the measurement of a latitude peculiar proper motion of comparable magnitude and error but with opposite sign in the companion paper by Reid leads us to conclude at the present time that our errors may be underestimated and that the actual peculiar motion might therefore be closer to zero. Improvement of these measurements with further observations and resolving the differences between independent experiments will provide the accuracies of a few km s\^{}-1 in both coordinates that will provide both a black hole mass estimate and a definitive determination of Oort's galactic rotation constants on a global Galactic scale.},

Recent high-resolution, multiwavelength observations indicate that the bulk of this activity derives from black hole accretion with a wide range of accretion rates. The low accretion rates that typify most low-luminosity active galactic nuclei induce significant modifications to their central engine. The broad-line region and obscuring torus disappear in some of the faintest sources, and the optically thick accretion disk transforms into a three-component structure consisting of an inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow, a truncated outer thin disk, and a jet or outflow. The local census of nuclear activity supports the notion that most, perhaps all, bulges host a central supermassive black hole, although the existence of active nuclei in at least some late-type galaxies suggests that a classical bulge is not a prerequisite to seed a nuclear black hole.},

	N2 = {We show how accretion rate governs the physical properties of a sample of unobscured broad-line, narrow-line, and lineless active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We avoid the systematic errors plaguing previous studies of AGN accretion rates by using accurate intrinsic accretion luminosities (L int) from well-sampled multiwavelength spectral energy distributions from the Cosmic Evolution Survey, and accurate black hole masses derived from virial scaling relations (for broad-line AGNs) or host-AGN relations (for narrow-line and lineless AGNs). In general, broad emission lines are present only at the highest accretion rates (L int/L Edd > 10-2), and these rapidly accreting AGNs are observed as broad-line AGNs or possibly as obscured narrow-line AGNs. Narrow-line and lineless AGNs at lower specific accretion rates (L int/L Edd < 10-2) are unobscured and yet lack a broad-line region. The disappearance of the broad emission lines is caused by an expanding radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) at the inner radius of the accretion disk. The presence of the RIAF also drives L int/L Edd < 10-2 narrow-line and lineless AGNs to have ratios of radio-to-optical/UV emission that are 10 times higher than L int/L Edd > 10-2 broad-line AGNs, since the unbound nature of the RIAF means it is easier to form a radio outflow. The IR torus signature also tends to become weaker or disappear from L int/L Edd < 10-2 AGNs, although there may be additional mid-IR synchrotron emission associated with the RIAF. Together, these results suggest that specific accretion rate is an important physical "axis" of AGN unification, as described by a simple model.

	N2 = {We quantify the importance of mass accretion during AGN phases in the growth of supermassive black holes (BH) by comparing the mass function of black holes in the local universe with that expected from AGN relics, which are black holes grown entirely with mass accretion during AGN phases. The local BH mass function (BHMF) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH mass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocity functions. The density of BHs in the local universe is ρBH = 4.6-1.4+1.9 h0.72 ρBHunits. The relic BHMF is derived from the continuity equation with the only assumption that AGN activity is due to accretion onto massive BHs and that merging is not important. We find that the relic BHMF at z = 0 is generated mainly at z<3. Moreover, the BH growth is anti-hierarchical in the sense that smaller BHs (MBH<107M{\.o}) grow at lower redshifts (z<1) with respect to more massive ones (z˜1-3). Unlike previous work, we find that the BHMF of AGN relics is perfectly consistent with the local BHMF indicating the local BHs were mainly grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained while satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the X-ray background. The comparison with the local BHMF also suggests that the merging process is not important in shaping the relic BHMF, at least at low redshifts (z<3). Our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local black holes grew during AGN phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencies ɛ= 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction λ= 0.1-1.7 and emitted at a fraction λ= 0.1-1.7 of the Eddington luminosity. The average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from ≃4.5×108 yr for MBH<108M{\.o}to ≃1.5 ×108 yr for MBH>109M{\.o}.},

	N2 = {As the luminosity of an accreting black hole drops to a few percent of Eddington, the spectrum switches from the familiar soft state to a hard state that is well-described by a distended and tenuous advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). An ADAF is a poor radiator, and the ion temperature can approach 10 K near the center, although the electrons are cooler, with their temperature typically capped at ˜10 K. The foundational papers predicted that the large thermal energy in an ADAF would drive strong winds and jets, as later observed and also confirmed in computer simulations. Of chief interest, however, is the accreting gas that races inward. It carries the bulk of the accretion energy as stored thermal energy, which vanishes without a trace as the gas passes through the hole's event horizon. One thus expects black holes in the ADAF regime to be unusually faint. Indeed, this is confirmed by a comparison of accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, which reside in very similar transient X-ray binary systems. The black holes are on average observed to be fainter by a factor of ˜100 1000. The natural explanation is that a neutron star must radiate the advected thermal energy from its surface, whereas a black hole can hide the energy behind its event horizon. The case for an event horizon in Sagittarius A∗, which is immune to caveats on jet outflows and is furthermore independent of the ADAF model, is especially compelling. These two lines of evidence for event horizons are impervious to counterarguments that invoke strong gravity or exotic stars.},

We propose that many XBONGs are powered by an inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) plus an outer radiatively efficient thin accretion disk. The absence of optical/UV activity in XBONGs is explained by the truncation of the thin disk near the black hole, while the relatively strong X-ray emission is explained as inverse Compton emission from the hot RIAF. As an example, we show that the spectra of two XBONGs can be fitted fairly well with such a model. By comparing these two sources to other accreting black holes, we argue that XBONGs are intermediate in their characteristics between distant, luminous active galactic nuclei and nearby, low-luminosity nuclei.},

This information helps to constrain the nature of their accretion flows and the physical drivers that control the spectral diversity of nearby active galactic nuclei. The characteristic values of the bolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios, which span over 7-8 orders of magnitude, from L bol lsim 1037 to 3 ×1044 erg s-1 and L bol/L Edd ≈10-9 to 10-1, vary systematically with nuclear spectral classification, increasing along the sequence absorption-line nuclei →transition objects →low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions →Seyferts. The Eddington ratio also increases from early-type to late-type galaxies. We show that the very modest accretion rates inferred from the nuclear luminosities can be readily supplied through local mass loss from evolved stars and Bondi accretion of hot gas, without appealing to additional fueling mechanisms such as angular momentum transport on larger scales. Indeed, we argue that the fuel reservoir generated by local processes should produce far more active nuclei than is actually observed. This generic luminosity-deficit problem suggests that the radiative efficiency in these systems is much less than the canonical value of 0.1 for traditional optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disks. The observed values of L bol/L Edd, all substantially below unity, further support the hypothesis that massive BHs in most nearby galaxies reside in a low or quiescent state, sustained by accretion through a radiatively inefficient mode.},

	N2 = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices αare subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Δα\~{}0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto \& Zoccali; Paresce \& De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez \& Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

Violent tidal forces acting on the disks draw out extended tails and trigger the formation of central bars. As such bars form, gas in the inner half of each disk loses most of its angular momentum through gravitational torques and falls into a compact cloud within the center of the galaxy. These nuclear gas clouds merge when their parent galaxies do, resulting in the rapid assembly of about 5 billion solar masses of gas, which may plausibly be identified with the large central clouds seen in CO observations of galaxies such as NGC 520. Violent star formation in such central gas clouds, which seems inevitable, offers a likely explanation for luminous IRAS galaxies and may contribute significantly to the central stellar populations of merger remnants. If some of the nuclear gas can continue to lose angular momentum, it may be able to fuel or even form a central black hole, resulting in a radio galaxy or possibly even a quasar.},

We find evidence for "cosmic downsizing" of black holes in BLQSOs, where the peak in their number density shifts to higher redshift with increasing black hole mass. The cosmic mass density for black holes seen as BLQSOs peaks at z \~{} 2. We estimate the completeness of the SDSS as a function of the black hole mass and Eddington ratio, and find that at z > 1 it is highly incomplete at M BH <\~{} 109 M sun and L/L Edd <\~{} 0.5. We estimate a lower limit on the lifetime of a single BLQSO phase to be t BL > 150 $\pm$15 Myr for black holes at z = 1 with a mass of M BH = 109 M sun, and we constrain the maximum mass of a black hole in a BLQSO to be \~{}3 ×1010 M sun. Our estimated distribution of BLQSO Eddington ratios peaks at L/L Edd \~{} 0.05 and has a dispersion of \~{}0.4 dex, implying that most BLQSOs are not radiating at or near the Eddington limit; however, the location of the peak is subject to considerable uncertainty. The steep increase in number density of BLQSOs toward lower Eddington ratios is expected if the BLQSO accretion rate monotonically decays with time. Furthermore, our estimated lifetime and Eddington ratio distributions imply that the majority of the most massive black holes spend a significant amount of time growing in an earlier obscured phase, a conclusion which is independent of the unknown obscured fraction. These results are consistent with models for self-regulated black hole growth, at least for massive systems at z > 1, where the BLQSO phase occurs at the end of a fueling event when black hole feedback unbinds the accreting gas, halting the accretion flow.},

	N2 = {We use the observed distribution of Eddington ratios as a function of supermassive black hole (BH) mass to constrain models of quasar/active galactic nucleus (AGN) lifetimes and light curves. Given the observed (well constrained) AGN luminosity function, a particular model for AGN light curves L(t) or, equivalently, the distribution of AGN lifetimes (time above a given luminosity t(>L)) translates directly and uniquely (without further assumptions) to a predicted distribution of Eddington ratios at each BH mass. Models for self-regulated BH growth, in which feedback produces a self-regulating "decay" or "blowout" phase after the AGN reaches some peak luminosity/BH mass and begins to expel gas and shut down accretion, make specific predictions for the light curves/lifetimes, distinct from, e.g., the expected distribution if AGN simply shut down by gas starvation (without feedback) and very different from the prediction of simple phenomenological "light bulb" scenarios. We show that the present observations of the Eddington ratio distribution, spanning nearly 5 orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio, 3 orders of magnitude in BH mass, and redshifts z = 0-1, agree well with the predictions of self-regulated models, and rule out phenomenological "light bulb" or pure exponential models, as well as gas starvation models, at high significance (\~{}5σ). We also compare with observations of the distribution of Eddington ratios at a given AGN luminosity, and find similar good agreement (but show that these observations are much less constraining). We fit the functional form of the quasar lifetime distribution and provide these fits for use, and show how the Eddington ratio distributions place precise, tight limits on the AGN lifetimes at various luminosities, in agreement with model predictions. We compare with independent estimates of episodic lifetimes and use this to constrain the shape of the typical AGN light curve, and provide simple analytic fits to these for use in other analyses. Given these constraints, the average local BH must have gained its mass in no more than a couple of bright, near peak-luminosity episodes, in agreement with models of accretion triggering in interactions and mergers.},

	N2 = {QSOs are believed to be powered by accretion onto massive black holes (BHs). In this paper, assuming that each central BH in nearby galaxies has experienced the QSO phase and ignoring BH mergers, we establish a relation between the QSO luminosity function (LF) and the local BH mass function (MF). The QSOLF is jointly controlled by the luminosity evolution of individual QSOs and the triggering history of the accretion onto seed BHs. By comparing the time integral of the QSOLF with that inferred from local BHs, we separate the effect of the luminosity evolution of individual QSOs from the effect of the triggering history. Assuming that the nuclear luminosity evolution includes two phases (first increasing at the Eddington luminosity with growth of BHs and then declining), we find that observations are generally consistent with the expected relation between the QSOLF and the local BHMF and obtain the following constraints on QSO models and BH growth: (i) The QSO mass-to-energy efficiency ɛshould be >\~{}0.1. (ii) The lifetime (defined directly through the luminosity evolution of individual QSOs here) should be >\~{}4×107 yr. The characteristic declining timescale in the second phase should be significantly shorter than the Salpeter timescale τSp, and BH growth should not be dominated by the second phase. (iii) The ratio of obscured QSOs/AGNs to optically bright QSOs should be not larger than 7 at MB\~{}-23 and 3 at MB\~{}-26 if ɛ=0.31, and not larger than 1 at MB\~{}-23 and negligible at MB\~{}-26 if ɛ=0.1. (iv) It is unlikely that most QSOs are accreting at super-Eddington luminosities. We point out that it is hard to accurately estimate the value of the QSO lifetime from the QSOLF and/or the local BHMF, if it is longer than a certain value (e.g., \~{}4τSp in this study). We discuss the importance of accurate measurements of the intrinsic scatter in the BH mass and velocity dispersion relation of local galaxies and the scatter in the bolometric correction of QSOs. We also discuss some possible applications of the work in this paper, such as to the study of the demography of QSOs and the demography of normal galaxies at intermediate redshift.},

	N2 = {Growth of massive black holes (MBHs) in galactic centers comes mainly from gas accretion during their QSO/AGN phases. In this paper we apply an extended So{\l}tan argument, connecting the local MBH mass function with the time integral of the QSO luminosity function to the demography of MBHs and QSOs from recent optical and X-ray surveys, and obtain robust constraints on the luminosity evolution (or mass growth history) of individual QSOs (or MBHs). We find that the luminosity evolution probably involves two phases, an initial exponentially increasing phase set by the Eddington limit and a following phase in which the luminosity declines with time as a power law (with a slope of \~{}-1.2 to -1.3) set by a self-similar long-term evolution of disk accretion. Neither an evolution involving only the increasing phase with a single Eddington ratio nor an exponentially declining pattern in the second phase is likely. The period of a QSO radiating at a luminosity higher than 10{\%} of its peak value is about (2-3)×108 yr, during which the MBH obtains \~{}80{\%} of its mass. The mass-to-energy conversion efficiency is \~{}=0.16+/-0.04+0.05-0, with the latter error accounting for the maximum uncertainty due to Compton-thick AGNs. The expected Eddington ratios in QSOs from the constrained luminosity evolution cluster around a single value close to 0.5-1 for high-luminosity QSOs and extend to a wide range of lower values for low-luminosity ones. The Eddington ratios for high-luminosity QSOs appear to conflict with those estimated from observations (\~{}0.25) by using some virial mass estimators for MBHs in QSOs, unless the estimators systematically overestimate MBH masses by a factor of 2-4. We also infer the fraction of optically obscured QSOs, \~{}60{\%}-80{\%}. The constraints obtained above are not affected significantly by MBH mergers and multiple times of nuclear activity (e.g., triggered by multiple times of galaxy wet major mergers) in the MBH growth history. We discuss further applications of the luminosity evolution of individual QSOs to obtaining the MBH mass function at high redshifts and the cosmic evolution of triggering rates of nuclear activity.},

The observed accretion rate distribution of AGNs (with host galaxy velocity dispersion σ\~{}=70-200 km s-1) in the nearby universe (z<0.3) is consistent with the predictions of simple theoretical models in which the accretion rates evolve in a self-similar way.

We compile a sample of \~{}100 active galactic nuclei with measured masses, 5-GHz core emission, and 2-10 keV luminosities, together with eight galactic black holes with a total of \~{}50 simultaneous observations in the radio and X-ray bands. Using this sample, we study the correlations between the radio (LR) and the X-ray (LX) luminosity and the black hole mass (M). We find that the radio luminosity is correlated with bothM and LX, at a highly significant level. In particular, we show that the sources define a `Fundamental Plane' in the three-dimensional (logLR, logLX, logM) space, given by logLR= (0.60+0.11-0.11) logLX+ (0.78+0.11-0.09) logM+ 7.33+4.05-4.07, with a substantial scatter of σR= 0.88. We compare our results to the theoretical relations between radio flux, black hole mass, and accretion rate derived by Heinz \& Sunyaev. Such relations depend only on the assumed accretion model and on the observed radio spectral index. Therefore, we are able to show that the X-ray emission from black holes accreting at less than a few per cent of the Eddington rate is unlikely to be produced by radiatively efficient accretion, and is marginally consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet. On the other hand, models for radiatively inefficient accretion flows seem to agree well with the data.},

	N2 = {A massive black hole (MBH) in a galactic center drives a flow of stars into nearly radial orbits to replace those it destroyed. Stars whose orbits cross the event horizon rS or the tidal disruption radius rt are promptly destroyed in an orbital period P. Stars with orbital periapse rp slightly larger than the sink radius q≡max(rS,rt) may slowly spiral in as a result of dissipative interactions with the MBH, e.g., gravitational wave emission, tidal heating, or accretion disk drag, with observable consequences and implications for the MBH growth rate. Unlike prompt destruction, the in-spiral time is typically >>P. This time is limited by the same scattering process that initially deflected the star into its eccentric orbit, since it can deflect it again to a wider orbit where dissipation is inefficient. The ratio between slow and prompt event rates is therefore much smaller than that implied by the ratio of cross sections, \~{}rp/q, and so only prompt disruption contributes significantly to the mass of the MBH. Conversely, most stars that scatter off the MBH survive the extreme tidal interaction (``tidal scattering''). We derive general expressions for the in-spiral event rate and the mean number of in-spiraling stars, and we show that the survival probability of tidally scattered stars is \~{}1 and that the number of tidally heated stars (``squeezars'') and gravity-wave-emitting stars in the galactic center is \~{}0.1-1.},

Through tidal interactions, energy and angular momentum are transferred between the disk and protostellar or protoplanetary companion. We summarize recent progress in theoretical investigations of the disk-companion tidal interaction. We show that low-mass protoplanets excite density waves at their Lindblad resonances and that these waves are likely to be dissipated locally. When a protoplanet acquires sufficient mass, its tidal torque induces the formation of a gap in the vicinity of its orbit. Gap formation leads to the termination of protoplanetary growth by accretion. For proto-Jupiter to attain its present mass, we require that (1) the primordial solar nebula is heated by viscous dissipation; (2) the viscous evolution time scale of the nebula is comparable to the age of typical T Tauri stars with circumstellar disks; and (3) the mass distribution in the nebula is comparable to that estimated from a minimum-mass nebula model.},

They are primarily concerned with systems in which the mass-input rate from the secondary to the disc around the primary, M*, is assumed to be constant. However, initial calculations with variable mass-input rates are also performed. The time-dependent visual magnitude light-curves are constructed for cataclysmic binaries with a range of disc size, primary mass, mass-input rate, and magnitude of viscosity (i.e. value of α). Comparisons are made between these theoretical results and the observed properties of various subclasses of cataclysmic variables. These results indicate that the observational differences between novae and dwarf novae may be due to differences in the mass-input rate. The authors' models can reproduce the gross observational features of U Gem-type dwarf-novae outbursts. For SS Cyg and Z Cam systems, modestly variable mass-input rates may also be required.},

These black holes can be captured by the central black hole when they randomly reach a highly eccentric orbit due to relaxation, either by direct capture (when their Newtonian peribothron is less than 4 Schwarzschild radii) or after losing orbital energy through gravitational waves. The overall depletion timescale is \~{}30 Gyr, so most of the 25,000 black holes remain in the central cluster today. The presence of this black hole cluster would have several observable consequences. First, the low-mass, old stellar population should have been expelled from the region occupied by the black hole cluster as a result of relaxation, implying a core in the profile of solar-mass red giants with a radius of \~{}2 pc (i.e., 1'). The observed central density cusp (which has a core radius of only a few arcseconds) should be composed primarily of young (<\~{}1 Gyr) stars. Second, flares from stars being captured by supermassive black holes in other galaxies should be rarer than usually expected because the older stars will have been expelled from the central regions by the black hole clusters of those galaxies. Third, the young (<\~{}2 Gyr) stars found at distances \~{}3-10 pc from the Galactic center should be preferentially on highly eccentric orbits. Fourth, if future high-resolution K-band images reveal sources microlensed by the Milky Way's central black hole, then the cluster black holes could give rise to secondary (``planet-like'') perturbations on the main event.},

The spectra from these systems range from 108 to 1020 Hz and are determined by considering cooling of electrons through synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and Compton processes. We show that the spectra can be quite accurately reproduced without detailed numerical calculations and that there is a strong testable correlation between the radio and X-ray fluxes from these systems. We describe how different regions of the spectrum scale with the mass of the accreting black hole, M, the accretion rate of the gas, M dot , and the equilibrium temperature of the electrons, Te. We show that the universal radio spectral index of 1/3 observed in most elliptical galaxies (Slee et al.) is a natural consequence of self-absorbed synchrotron radiation from these flows. We also give expressions for the total luminosity of these flows and the critical accretion rate, M dot {\_}{\{}{\{}crit{\}}{\}} , above which the advection solutions cease to exist. We find that for most cases of interest, the equilibrium electron temperature is fairly insensitive to M, M dot , and parameters in the model. We apply these results to low-luminosity black holes in galactic nuclei. We show that the problem posed by Fabian \& Canizares of whether bright elliptical galaxies host dead quasars is resolved, as pointed out recently by Fabian \& Rees, by considering advection-dominated flows.},

	N2 = {In our second paper on long-term quasar variability, we employ a much larger database of quasars than in de Vries, Becker \& White. This expanded sample, containing 35,165 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2 and 6413 additional quasars in the same area of the sky taken from the Two Degree Field (2dF) QSO Redshift Survey, allows us to significantly improve on our earlier conclusions. As before, all the historic quasar photometry has been calibrated onto the SDSS scale by using large numbers of calibration stars around each quasar position. We find the following: (1) The outbursts have an asymmetric light-curve profile, with a fast-rise, slow-decline shape; this argues against a scenario in which microlensing events along the line of sight to the quasars are dominating the long-term variations in quasars. (2) There is no turnover in the structure function of the quasars up to timescales of \~{}40 yr, and the increase in variability with increasing time lags is monotonic and constant. (3) Consequently, there is not a single preferred characteristic outburst timescale for the quasars, but most likely a continuum of outburst timescales. (4) The magnitude of the quasar variability is a function of wavelength: variability increases toward the blue part of the spectrum. (5) High-luminosity quasars vary less than low-luminosity quasars, consistent with a scenario in which variations have limited absolute magnitude. On this basis, we conclude that quasar variability is intrinsic to the active galactic nucleus and is caused by chromatic outbursts or flares that have limited luminosity range, varying timescales, and an overall asymmetric light-curve shape. Currently, the model that has the most promise of fitting the observations is based on accretion disk instabilities.},

For the most part we find continuous formulae accurate to within 5 per cent of detailed models.

	N2 = {Two-body relaxation times of nuclear star clusters are short enough that gravitational encounters should substantially affect their structure in 10 Gyr or less. In nuclear star clusters without massive black holes, dynamical evolution is a competition between core collapse, which causes densities to increase, and heat input from the surrounding galaxy, which causes densities to decrease. The maximum extent of a nucleus that can resist expansion is derived numerically for a wide range of initial conditions; observed nuclei are shown to be compact enough to resist expansion, although there may have been an earlier generation of low-density nuclei that were dissolved. An evolutionary model for NGC 205 is presented which suggests that the nucleus of this galaxy has already undergone core collapse. Adding a massive black hole to a nucleus inhibits core collapse, and nuclear star clusters with black holes always expand, due primarily to heat input from the galaxy and secondarily to heating from stellar disruptions. The expansion rate is smaller for larger black holes due to the smaller temperature difference between galaxy and nucleus when the black hole is large. The rate of stellar tidal disruptions and its variation with time are computed for a variety of initial models. The disruption rate generally decreases with time due to the evolving nuclear density, particularly in the faintest galaxies, assuming that scaling relations derived for luminous galaxies can be extended to low luminosities.},

Some fraction of this activity is associated with the accretion of the material liberated by the tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes. We estimate the contribution to the X-ray luminosity function from the tidal disruption process. While the contribution depends on a number of poorly known parameters, it appears that it can account for the majority of X-ray-selected AGNs with soft or hard X-ray luminosities <\~{}1043-1044 ergs s-1. If this is correct, a significant portion of the X-ray luminosity function of AGNs is comprised of sources powered by tidal disruption at the faint end, while the sources at the bright end are powered by nonstellar accretion. Black holes with masses <\~{}2×106 Msolar could have acquired most of their present mass by an accretion of tidal debris. In view of the considerable theoretical uncertainty concerning the detailed shape of the light curves of tidal disruption events, we focus on power-law luminosity decay (as identified in candidate tidal disruption events), but we also discuss constant accretion rate models. We expect that the sources associated with thin-disk accretion of circularized tidal debris have peak luminosities of <\~{}1039-1041 ergs s-1, below the luminosity range probed in present surveys.},

	N2 = {Using a simple description of feedback from black hole growth, we develop an analytic model for the fueling of Seyferts (low-luminosity active galactic nuclei {$[$}AGNs{$]$}) and their relation to their host galaxies, Eddington ratio distributions, and cosmological evolution. We derive a solution for the time evolution of accretion rates in a feedback-driven blast wave, applicable to large-scale outflows from bright quasars in galaxy mergers, low-luminosity AGNs, and black holes or neutron stars in supernova remnants. Under the assumption that cold gas stochastically accretes onto a central supermassive black hole at a rate set by the dynamics of that gas, our solution determines the evolution of Seyfert light curves. Using this model, we predict the Seyfert luminosity function, duty cycles and AGN ``lifetimes,'' and the distribution of host morphologies, Eddington ratios, and obscuration as a function of AGN luminosity and black hole mass, and we find agreement with observations at z=0. We consider the breakdown of the contribution from this mechanism and from stellar wind and virialized hot gas accretion and merger-driven activity. We also make specific predictions for the weak evolution of the Seyfert luminosity function; i.e., luminosity function of quiescent as opposed to merger-driven activity, as a function of redshift, and for changes in both the slope and scatter of the MBH-σrelation at low MBH. Our modeling provides a quantitative and physical distinction between local, low-luminosity quiescent AGN activity and violent, merger-driven bright quasars. In our picture, the quiescent mode of fueling dominates over a wide range of luminosities (-15>\~{}MB>\~{}-22) at z=0, where most black hole growth occurs in objects with MBH<\~{}107 Msolar, in S0 and Sa/b galaxies. However, quasar activity from gas-rich mergers evolves more rapidly with redshift, and by z=1, quiescent fueling is important only at luminosities an order of magnitude or more below the ``break'' in the luminosity function. Consequently, although non-merger-driven fueling is important for black hole growth and the MBH-σrelation at low MBH, it does not significantly contribute to the black hole mass density of the universe or to cosmological backgrounds. We dedicate this paper to John Bahcall, who inspired our interest in this problem.},

Using the \~{}8500 broad-line active galaxies from SDSS DR4, we construct a broad-line luminosity function that agrees very well with the local soft X-ray luminosity function. Using standard virial relations, we then convert observed broad-line luminosities and widths into BH masses. A mass function constructed in this way has the unique capability to probe the mass region <106 Msolar, which, while insignificant in terms of total BH mass density, nevertheless may place important constraints on the mass distribution of seed BHs in the early universe. The characteristic local active BH has a mass of \~{}107 Msolar radiating at 10{\%} of the Eddington rate. The active fraction is a strong function of BH mass; at both higher and lower masses the active mass function falls more steeply than one would infer from the distribution of bulge luminosity. The deficit of local massive radiating BHs is a well-known phenomenon, while we present the first robust measurement of a decline in the space density of active BHs at low mass.},

An upper limit for the disruption rate of the order of the mass of the core divided by the relaxation time is derived.

Collisionless effects may be important in radiatively inefficient accretion flows, such as near the black hole in the Galactic center. The MHD version of ZEUS is modified to evolve an anisotropic pressure tensor. A fluid closure approximation is used to calculate heat conduction along magnetic field lines. The anisotropic pressure tensor provides a qualitatively new mechanism for transporting angular momentum in accretion flows (in addition to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses). We estimate limits on the pressure anisotropy due to pitch angle scattering by kinetic instabilities. Such instabilities provide an effective ``collision'' rate in a collisionless plasma and lead to more MHD-like dynamics. We find that the MRI leads to efficient growth of the magnetic field in a collisionless plasma, with saturation amplitudes comparable to those in MHD. In the saturated state, the anisotropic stress is comparable to the Maxwell stress, implying that the rate of angular momentum transport may be moderately enhanced in a collisionless plasma.},

In this paper, we present the collected X-ray properties (0.3-12 keV) for the 153 AGNs detected. In addition, we examine the X-ray properties for a complete sample of nonbeamed sources, above the Galactic plane (b >= 15$\,^{\circ}$). Of these, 45{\%} are best fit by simple power law models, while 55{\%} require the more complex partial covering model. One of our goals was to determine the fraction of "hidden" AGNs, which we define as sources with scattering fractions less than or equal to 0.03 and ratios of soft to hard X-ray flux less than or equal to 0.04. We found that "hidden" AGNs constitute a high percentage of the sample (24{\%}), proving that they are a very significant portion of local AGNs. Further, we find that the fraction of absorbed sources does increase at lower unabsorbed 2-10 keV luminosities, as well as accretion rates. This suggests that the unified model requires modification to include luminosity dependence, as suggested by models such as the "receding torus" model. Some of the most interesting results for the BAT AGN sample involve the host galaxy properties. We found that 33{\%} are hosted in peculiar/irregular galaxies and only 5/74 are hosted in ellipticals. Further, 54{\%} are hosted in interacting/merger galaxies. Finally, we present both the average X-ray spectrum (0.1-10 keV) and log N-log S in the 2-10 keV band. With our average spectrum, we have the remarkable result of reproducing the measured CXB X-ray power law slope of Γ≈1.4. From the log N-log S relationship, we show that we are complete to log S >= -11 in the 2-10 keV band. Below this value, we are missing as many as 3000 sources at log S = -12.

It is of great interest to understand how the current uncertainty on the hydrogen/deuterium equation of state (EOS) affects the inferred structures of Jupiter and Saturn. In particular, the mass of a core of heavy elements (other than H and He) and the total mass of those heavy elements in these two planets are quite sensitive to the EOS of hydrogen and constitute important clues to their formation process. We present a study of the range of structures allowed for Jupiter and Saturn by the current uncertainty in the hydrogen EOS and astrophysical observations of the two planets. An improved experimental understanding of hydrogen at megabar pressures and better determinations of the gravitational moments of both planets are necessary to put tight bounds on their internal structure.},

Several previous studies have considered the emission resulting from the accretion of bound material; we consider the possibility that the unbound debris may also radiate once it has expanded and become transparent. We show that the gradual energy input from hydrogen recombination compensates for adiabatic losses over significant expansion factors. The opacity also drops dramatically with recombination, and the internal energy can be radiated by means of a cooling-transparency wave propagating from the surface layers inward. The result is a brief optical transient occurring \~{} 1 week after disruption and lasting 3-5 days with peak luminosities of 1040-1042 ergs s-1, depending on the mass of the disrupted star. These recombination powered transients should accompany the X-ray/ultraviolet flare from the accretion of bound material, and so may be a useful signature for discriminating tidal disruption events, especially for lower and intermediate mass black holes.},

This can be used to robustly select AGNs in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z < 1). We compare the result of this optical AGN selection with X-ray selection using a sample of 3150 galaxies with 0.3 < z < 0.8 and I AB < 22, selected from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. Among the 146 X-ray sources in this sample, 58{\%} are classified optically as emission-line AGNs, the rest as star-forming galaxies or absorption-dominated galaxies. The latter are also known as "X-ray bright, optically normal galaxies" (XBONGs). Analysis of the relationship between optical emission lines and X-ray properties shows that the completeness of optical AGN selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate and the quality of observed spectra. It also shows that XBONGs do not appear to be a physically distinct population from other X-ray detected, emission-line AGNs. On the other hand, X-ray AGN selection also has strong bias. About 2/3 of all emission-line AGNs at L bol > 1044 erg s-1 in our sample are not detected in our 200 ks Chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gas near the AGN. The 2-7 keV detection rate of Seyfert 2s at z \~{} 0.6 suggests that their column density distribution and Compton-thick fraction are similar to that of local Seyferts. Multiple sample selection techniques are needed to obtain as complete a sample as possible.},

A core of initial radius 1-1.5 pc evolves to a size of approximately 0.5 pc after 10 Gyr, roughly the size of the observed core. The absence of a Bahcall-Wolf cusp is naturally explained in these models, without the need for fine-tuning or implausible initial conditions. In the absence of a cusp, the time for a 10 M sun black hole (BH) to spiral in to the Galactic center from an initial distance of 5 pc can be much greater than 10 Gyr. Assuming that the stellar BHs had the same phase-space distribution initially as the stars, their density after 5-10 Gyr is predicted to rise very steeply going into the stellar core, but could remain substantially below the densities inferred from steady-state models that include a steep density cusp in the stars. Possible mechanisms for the creation of the parsec-scale initial core include destruction of stars on centrophilic orbits in a pre-existing triaxial nucleus, inhibited star formation near the SMBH, or ejection of stars by a massive binary. The implications of these models are discussed for the rates of gravitational-wave inspiral events, as well as other physical processes that depend on a high density of stars or stellar-mass BHs near SgrA*.},

We assume that black holes accrete in just three distinct physical states, or `modes': at low Eddington ratio, only a radiatively inefficient, kinetically dominated mode is allowed {$[$}low kinetic (LK){$]$} at high Eddington ratio, instead, AGN may display both a purely radiative {$[$}radio quiet, high radiative (HR){$]$} and a kinetic {$[$}radio loud, high kinetic (HK){$]$} mode. We solve the continuity equation for the black hole mass function using the locally determined one as a boundary condition, and the hard X-ray luminosity function as tracer of the AGN growth rate distribution, supplemented with a luminosity-dependent bolometric correction and an absorbing column distribution. Differently from most previous semi-analytic and numerical models for black hole growth, we do not assume any specific distribution of Eddington ratios, rather we determine it empirically by coupling the mass and luminosity functions and a set of fundamental relations between observables in the three accretion modes. SMBH always show a very broad accretion rate distribution, and we discuss the profound consequences of this fact for our understanding of observed AGN fractions in galaxies, as well as for the empirical determination of SMBH mass functions with large surveys. We confirm previous results and clearly demonstrate that, at least for z <\~{} 1.5, SMBH mass function evolves antihierarchically, i.e. the most massive holes grew earlier and faster than less massive ones. For the first time, we find hints of a reversal of such a downsizing behaviour at redshifts above the peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z \~{} 2). We also derive tight constraints on the (mass-weighted) average radiative efficiency of AGN: under the simplifying assumption that the mass density of both high redshift (z \~{} 5) and `wandering' black holes ejected from galactic nuclei after merger events are negligible compared to the local mass density, we find that 0.065 < ξ0<ɛrad> < 0.07, where ξ0 is the local SMBH mass density in units of 4.3 ×105MsolarMpc-3. We trace the cosmological evolution of the kinetic luminosity function of AGN, and find that the overall efficiency of SMBH in converting accreted rest mass energy into kinetic power, ɛkin, ranges between ɛkin \~{}= (3-5) ×10-3, depending on the choice of the radio core luminosity function. Such a `kinetic efficiency' varies however strongly with SMBH mass and redshift, being maximal for very massive holes at late times, as required for the AGN feedback by many galaxy formation models in cosmological contexts.},

	N2 = {I present a new method to unveil the history of cosmic accretion and the build-up of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the nuclei of galaxies, based on observations of the evolving radio and (hard) X-ray luminosity functions of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The fundamental plane of black hole activity discovered by Merloni, Heinz \& Di Matteo, which defines a universal correlation among black hole mass (M), 2-10keV X-ray luminosity and 5-GHz radio luminosity is used as a mass and accretion rate estimator, provided a specific functional form for the dependency of the X-ray luminosity on the dimensionless accretion rate mdot is assumed. I adopt the local black hole mass function (BHMF) as derived from the velocity dispersion (σ) distributions of nearby galaxies coupled with the M-σrelation as a boundary condition to integrate backwards in time the continuity equation for the evolution of SMBH, neglecting the role of mergers in shaping up the BHMF. Under the most general assumption that, independently on M, black hole accretion proceeds in a radiatively efficient way above a certain rate, and in a radiatively inefficient way below it, the redshift evolution of the BHMF and the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) function (i.e. the distribution of the Eddington scaled accretion rates for objects of any given mass) are calculated self-consistently. The only tunable parameters are the overall efficiency of extracting gravitational energy from the accreting gas, ɛ, and the critical ratio of the X-ray to Eddington luminosity, L2-10keV,cr/LEdd≡xcr, at which the transition between accretion modes takes place. For fiducial values of these parameters (ɛ= 0.1 and xcr= 10-3), I found that half (\~{}85 per cent) of the local black hole mass density was accumulated at redshift z < 1 (z < 3), mostly in radiatively efficient episodes of accretion. The evolution of the BHMF between z= 0 and z\~{} 3 shows clear signs of an anti-hierarchical behaviour: while the majority of the most massive objects (M>\~{} 109) were already in place at z\~{} 3, lower mass ones mainly grew at progressively lower redshift, so that the average black hole mass increases with increasing redshift. In addition, the average accretion rate decreases towards lower redshift. Consequently, sources in the radiatively inefficient regime of accretion only begin to dominate the comoving accretion energy density in the Universe at z < 1 (with the exact value of z depending on xcr), while at the peak of the BHAR history, radiatively efficient accretion dominates by almost an order of magnitude. I will discuss the implications of these results for the efficiency of accretion on to SMBH, the lifetimes of quasars and duty cycles, the history of AGN feedback in the form of mechanical energy output and, more generally, for the cosmological models of structure formation in the Universe.},

	N2 = {The relationship between high-redshift quasars and the epoch of galaxy formation in the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmogony is investigated. Luminous quasars could only form after galactic sized systems had collapsed. A constant comoving density of luminous quasars between z = 2 and z = 4 is compatible with the CDM model if quasars are short-lived and radiate at about the Eddington limit. However, according to the CDM model, the abundance of high-luminosity quasars must decline exponentially at higher redshifts. Even if all protogalaxies form quasars and about 1 percent of the baryons within a protogalaxy collapse into a compact object, a steep fall in the density of quasars with L of greater than 10 to the 47th erg/s at redshifts z of greater than about 5 would be expected. The existence of a 'cut-off' in the quasar numbers at high redshift could therefore supply an important test of the CDM theory.},

	N2 = {We derive quantitative predictions of the optical and X-ray luminosity functions for quasars in the redshift range z<\~{}3. Based on accreting black holes as primary sources for the quasar outputs, we investigate how the accretion is controlled by the surrounding structures, as these grow hierarchically from the formation of the host galaxies to their assemblage into poor and eventually into rich groups. We argue that for z<3 efficient black hole fueling is triggered by the encounters of a gas-rich host with its companions in a group; these destabilize the gas and induce accretion, giving rise to the following features. The dispersion of the dynamical parameters in the encounters produces luminosity functions with the shape of a double power law. Strong luminosity evolution is produced as these encounters deplete the gas supply in the host; an additional, milder density evolution obtains, since the interactions become progressively rarer as the groups grow richer but less dense. We carry out these arguments to derive a specific model for the evolving luminosity functions. From the agreement with the optical and the X-ray data, we conclude that the evolution of the bright quasars is driven by the development of cosmic structures in two ways. Earlier than z\~{}3 the gas-rich protogalaxies grow by merging, which also induces parallel growth of central holes accreting at their full Eddington rates. In the later era of group assemblage the host encounters with companions drive onto already existing holes further but meager accretion; these events consume the gas reservoirs in the hosts, while they cause supply-limited emissions that are intermittent, go progressively sub-Eddington, and peter out. Then other fueling processes occurring in the field come to the foreground; we specifically discuss the faint emissions, especially noticeable in X-rays, which are expected when hosts in the field cannibalize satellite galaxies with their scant gaseous contents.},

The iron emission blend at rest wavelength 2900-3000 {\AA}is clearly detected, and its strength appears nearly indistinguishable from that of typical quasars at lower redshifts. The Fe II/Mg II ratio is also similar to values found for lower redshift quasars, demonstrating that there is no strong evolution in Fe/αbroad-line emission ratios even out to z=6.4. In the context of current models for iron enrichment from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), this implies that the SN Ia progenitor stars formed at z>\~{}10. We apply the scaling relations of Vestergaard and of McLure \& Jarvis to estimate the black hole mass from the widths of the C IV and Mg II emission lines and the ultraviolet continuum luminosity. The derived mass is in the range (2-6)×109 Msolar, with an additional uncertainty of a factor of 3 due to the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations. This result is in agreement with the previous mass estimate of 3×109 Msolar by Willott, McLure, \& Jarvis and supports their conclusion that the quasar is radiating close to its Eddington luminosity.},

	N2 = {We analyse the observed distribution of Eddington ratios (L/LEdd) as a function of supermassive black hole mass for a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We demonstrate that there are two distinct regimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. The first is associated with galaxies with significant star formation {$[$}M*/starformationrate (SFR) \~{} a Hubble time{$]$} in their central kiloparsec regions, and is characterized by a broad lognormal distribution of accretion rates peaked at a few per cent of the Eddington limit. In this regime, the Eddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole and shows little dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy. The second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellar populations (M*/SFR >> a Hubble time), and is characterized by a power-law distribution function of Eddington ratios. In this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate on to black holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars. This result is once again independent of black hole mass. We show that both the slope of the power law and the decrease in the accretion rate on to black holes in old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions of the decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. Our results lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the local Universe. If the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the black hole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on the properties of the interstellar medium. Once the gas runs out, black hole growth is regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.},

They are interesting since binary systems with sub-Chandrasekhar-mass primary WDs should be common and this scenario would suggest a simple physical parameter which determines the explosion brightness, namely the mass of the exploding WD. Here we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, associated post-processing nucleosynthesis, and multi-wavelength radiation transport calculations for pure detonations of carbon-oxygen WDs. The light curves and spectra we obtain from these simulations are in good agreement with observed properties of SNe Ia. In particular, for WD masses from 0.97 to 1.15 M sun we obtain 56Ni masses between 0.3 and 0.8 M sun, sufficient to capture almost the complete range of SN Ia brightnesses. Our optical light curve rise times, peak colors, and decline timescales display trends which are generally consistent with observed characteristics although the range of B-band decline timescales displayed by our current set of models is somewhat too narrow. In agreement with observations, the maximum light spectra of the models show clear features associated with intermediate-mass elements and reproduce the sense of the observed correlation between explosion luminosity and the ratio of the Si II lines at λ6355 and λ5972. We therefore suggest that sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions are a viable model for SNe Ia for any binary evolution scenario leading to explosions in which the optical display is dominated by the material produced in a detonation of the primary WD.},

Recent observational efforts have doubled the number of SNe Ia with very early spectra. Remarkably, all SNe Ia with early data (seven in our Research Training Network sample and 10 from other programs) show signs of such features, to a greater or lesser degree, in Ca II IR and some also in the Si II λ6355 line. HVFs may be interpreted as abundance or density enhancements. Abundance enhancements would imply an outer region dominated by Si and Ca. Density enhancements may result from the sweeping up of circumstellar material (CSM) by the highest velocity SN ejecta. In this scenario, the high incidence of HVFs suggests that a thick disk and/or a high-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be the case in single degenerate systems. Large-scale angular fluctuations in the radial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this could originate in the explosion and would suggest a deflagration as the more likely explosion mechanism. CSM interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist, possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. In some SNe, the HVFs are narrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burned material.},

Occasionally, a star passing too near an MBH is torn apart by gravitational forces, leading to a bright tidal disruption flare (TDF). Although the high-energy transient Sw 1644+57 initially displayed none of the theoretically anticipated (nor previously observed) TDF characteristics, we show that observations suggest a sudden accretion event onto a central MBH of mass about 106 to 107 solar masses. There is evidence for a mildly relativistic outflow, jet collimation, and a spectrum characterized by synchrotron and inverse Compton processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw 1644+57 to a temporary smaller-scale blazar.},

We utilize spectroscopic redshifts from SDSS and ChaMP, as well as photometric redshifts from several SDSS catalogs, to compile a Parent sample of more than 100,000 SDSS galaxies and nearly 1600 Chandra X-ray detections. Detailed ChaMP volume completeness maps allow us to investigate the local fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), defined as those objects having broadband X-ray luminosities LX (0.5-8 keV) >=1042 erg s-1, as a function of absolute optical magnitude, X-ray luminosity, redshift, mass, and host color/morphological type. In five independent samples complete in redshift and i-band absolute magnitude, we determine the field AGN fraction to be between 0.16{\%} $\pm$0.06{\%} (for z <= 0.125 and -18>Mi > - 20) and 3.80{\%} $\pm$0.92{\%} (for z <= 0.7 and Mi < -23). We find excellent agreement between our ChaMP/SDSS field AGN fraction and the Chandra cluster AGN fraction, for samples restricted to similar redshift and absolute magnitude ranges: 1.19{\%} $\pm$0.11{\%} of ChaMP/SDSS field galaxies with 0.05 < z < 0.31 and absolute R-band magnitude more luminous than MR < -20 are AGNs. Our results are also broadly consistent with measures of the field AGN fraction in narrow, deep fields, though differences in the optical selection criteria, redshift coverage, and possible cosmic variance between fields introduce larger uncertainties in these comparisons.},

After a discussion of the mass requirements for fueling, I summarize this observational work and provide a number of hypotheses for why the nature of AGN fueling has remained unresolved. In particular, I stress the potential importance of the increasing number of candidate fueling mechanisms with decreasing mass accretion rate, the relevant spatial scales for different fueling mechanisms, and the lifetime of an individual episode of nuclear accretion. The episodic AGN lifetime is a particularly relevant complication if it is comparable to or shorter than the time that the responsible fueling mechanisms are observationally detectable. I conclude with a number of relatively accessible areas for future investigation.},

I will review various fueling mechanisms for a R ≅0.1 kpc region, determined mainly by numerical simulations over the last decade. I will also comment on the bars-within-bars mechanism. Observations suggest that the stellar bar is not a sufficient condition for gas fueling. Moreover, considering the various factors for the onset of gas accretion, stellar bars would not even be a necessary condition. I introduce recent progress obtained through our two- and three-dimensional, high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the ISM in the central 0.1--1 kpc region of galaxies. Possible structure of the obscuring molecular tori around AGNs is also shown. The nuclear starburst is an important factor in determining the structure of the molecular tori and the mass accretion rate to the nucleus. It is natural that the ISM in the central 100 pc region is a highly inhomogeneous and turbulent structure. As a result, gas accretion to the central parsec region should be time dependent and stochastic. The conventional picture of gas fueling and the AGN unified model may be modified in many respects.},

From a variety of ROSAT, XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys we selected a total of \~{}1000 AGN with an unprecedented spectroscopic and photometric optical/NIR identification completeness. For the first time we are able to derive reliable space densities for low-luminosity (Seyfert-type) X-ray sources at cosmological redshifts. The evolutionary behaviour of AGN shows a strong dependence on X-ray luminosity: while the space density of high-luminosity AGN reaches a peak around z˜2, similar to that of optically selected QSO, the space density of low-luminosity AGNs peaks at redshifts below z=1. This confirms previous ROSAT findings of a luminosity-dependent density evolution. Using a rigorous treatment of the optical identification completeness we are able to show that the space density of AGN with X-ray luminosities Lx < 1045 erg s-1 declines significantly towards high redshifts.},

Cross sections for tidal disruptions are calculated, taking into account the thermal energy of stars, relativistic effects, and partial disruption removing only the outer layers of a star. Accretion rates are computed for a realistic distribution of stellar masses and evolutionary phases, the effect of the black hole on the cluster distribution is examined, and the red-giant disruption rate is evaluated for hole mass of at least 300 million solar masses, the cutoff of disruption of main-sequence stars. The results show that this black-tide model can explain QSO luminosities of at least 1 trillion suns if the black hole remains almost maximally Kerr as it grows above 100 million solar masses and if 'loss-cone' depletion of the number of stars in disruptive orbits is unimportant.},

The analysis incorporates the two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in energy (E) and angular-momentum (J) space, for which the approximate velocity-diffusion coefficients computed for the case of a Maxwellian field-star distribution are employed. The distribution of the stars as a function of J is determined for small J by considering the rate at which stars of fixed E enter the loss cone; a Fokker-Planck equation in E alone and containing an energy-dependent 'sink' term is obtained by integrating the two-dimensional equation over J and substituting an expression for the stellar consumption rate; and the approximate steady-state solution to this equation in the 'self-similar' regime is found along with the total rate at which the central object consumes stars. The results are applied to a massive black hole at the center of a globular cluster (M15) and an elliptical galaxy.},

The disruption rates are smaller than previously believed with solar N \~{} 10\^{}-4-10\^{}-7 per galaxy. A correlation between solarN and black hole mass M is exploited to estimate the rate of tidal disruptions in the local Universe. Assuming that all or most galaxies have massive black holes in their nuclei, this rate should be dominated by sub-L{\_}* galaxies. The rate of tidal disruptions could be high enough to be detected in supernova (or similar) monitoring campaigns - we estimate the rate of tidal disruptions to be 0.01-0.1 times the supernova rate. We have also estimated the rates of disruption of red giants, which may be significant (solar N >= 10\^{}-4 yr\^{}-1 per galaxy) for M >= 10\^{}8 M{\_}solar, but are likely to be harder to observe - only of order 10\^{}-4 times the supernova rate in the local Universe.

Examples of such disks are those generated by the merger of a white dwarf with a neutron star or black hole, or by the collapse of a rotating star. Here, we present two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that systematically explore the effect of adding a single nuclear reaction to a viscous torus. The equation of state, anomalous shear stress, and nuclear reactions are given parametric forms. Our results point to the existence of two qualitatively different regimes of NuDAF evolution: (1) steady accretion with quiescent burning or (2) detonation of the disk. These outcomes are controlled primarily by the ratio Ψof the nuclear energy released to the enthalpy at the burning radius. Disks detonate if Ψexceeds a critical value Ψcrit \~{} 1, and if burning occurs in regions where neutrino cooling is unimportant. Thermonuclear runaways are seeded by the turbulent mixing of hot ash with cold fuel at the burning front. Disks with Ψ< Ψcrit do not explode, but instead power a persistent collimated outflow of unbound material composed primarily of ash, with a mass-loss rate that increases with Ψ. We discuss the implications of our results for supernova-like counterparts from astrophysical events in the NuDAF regime. In particular, detonations following a white dwarf-neutron star merger could account for some subluminous Type Ia supernovae, such as the class defined by SN 2002cx.},

Our models span a range of effective linear spatial resolutions from 5.2 ×107 to 1.2 ×107 cm. However, even the highest resolution models do not quite achieve strict numerical convergence, due to the challenge of properly resolving small-scale burning and energy transport. The lack of strict numerical convergence from these idealized configurations suggests that quantitative predictions of the ejected elemental abundances that are generated by binary WD collision and merger simulations should be viewed with caution. Nevertheless, the convergence trends do allow some patterns to be discerned. We find that the 0.64 + 0.64 M \&sun; head-on collision model produces 0.32 M \&sun; of 56Ni and 0.38 M \&sun; of 28Si, while the 0.81 + 0.81 M \&sun; head-on collision model produces 0.39 M \&sun; of 56Ni and 0.55 M \&sun; of 28Si at the highest spatial resolutions. Both mass pairings produce \~{}0.2 M \&sun; of unburned 12C+16O. We also find the 0.64 + 0.64 M \&sun; head-on collision begins carbon burning in the central region of the stalled shock between the two WDs, while the more energetic 0.81 + 0.81 M \&sun; head-on collision raises the initial post-shock temperature enough to burn the entire stalled shock region to nuclear statistical equilibrium.},

	N2 = {Most large elliptical galaxies should now host a massive black hole left over from an earlier quasar phase. Such galaxies also have an extensive hot gaseous halo. Here we consider why the nuclei of elliptical galaxies are not luminous sources as a result of the accretion of the hot gas by the central black hole, yet have weak radio sources. In particular, we suggest that accretion from the hot medium has low radiative efficiency and forms a hot ion torus surrounding the black hole. Synchrotron emission from the torus can account for at least part of the weak radio sources commonly seen in otherwise normal elliptical galaxies. The inner funnel of the ion torus can also begin the collimation of a narrow jet. We speculate on the difference between jets from the nuclei of spiral and elliptical galaxies, and suggest that the extensive hot atmosphere seen in ellipticals is essential for maintaining the collimation and provoking the observed radio structures of radio galaxies. We also note that low radiative efficiency, and not necessarily a large change in accretion rate, may be responsible for the demise of quasars and may contribute to the hard X-ray background. Hot ion tori may be common in galactic nuclei.},

	N2 = {We construct one-dimensional steady-state models of accretion discs produced by the tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by a neutron star (NS) or stellar mass black hole (BH). At radii r ≲108.5-109 cm the mid-plane density and temperature are sufficiently high to burn the initial WD material into increasingly heavier elements (e.g. Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe and Ni) at sequentially smaller radii. When the energy released by nuclear reactions is comparable to that released gravitationally, we term the disc a nuclear-dominated accretion flow (NuDAF). At small radii ≲107 cm iron photodisintegrates into helium and then free nuclei, and in the very innermost disc cooling by neutrinos may be efficient. At the high accretion rates of relevance ˜10-4 to 0.1 M\&sun; s-1, most of the disc is radiatively inefficient and prone to outflows powered by viscous dissipation and nuclear burning. Outflow properties are calculated by requiring that material in the mid-plane be marginally bound (Bernoulli constant ≲0), due (in part) to cooling by matter escaping the disc. For reasonable assumptions regarding the properties of disc winds, we show that a significant fraction (≳50-80 per cent) of the total WD mass is unbound. The composition of the ejecta is predominantly O, C, Si, Mg, Ne, Fe and S {$[$}He, C, Si, S, Ar and Fe{$]$}, in the case of C-O {$[$}pure He{$]$} WDs, respectively, along with a small quantity ˜10-3 to 10-2 M\&sun; of radioactive 56Ni and, potentially, a trace amount of hydrogen. Depending on the pressure dependence of wind cooling, we find that the disc may be thermally unstable to nuclear burning, the likelihood of which increases for higher mass WDs. We use our results to evaluate possible electromagnetic counterparts of WD-NS/BH mergers, including optical transients powered by the radioactive decay of 56Ni and radio transients powered by the interaction of the ejecta with the interstellar medium. We address whether recently discovered subluminous Type I supernovae result from WD-NS/BH mergers. Ultimately assessing the fate of these events requires global simulations of the disc evolution, which capture the complex interplay between nuclear burning, convection and outflows.},

For intermediate accretion rates, the helium flash is so strong that it produces a helium detonation wave propagating outward and a carbon detonation wave propagating inward, which results in most of the star's material being converted into N-56 and the star itself being completely disrupted. For the case with a slower accretion rate, the helium flash is only strong enough to form a single detonation wave propagating outward, leaving behind either a white dwarf remnant or disrupting the star completely, depending on conditions in the white dwarf. The ejecta of double detonation supernovae is composed mostly of N-56, while the single detonation ejects a small amount of N-56 or N-56, C, and O in the case of total disruption. These models are compared with observed features of type I supernovae.},

The high sensitivity of these grism observations, with >5-sigma detections of emission lines to f > 2.5x10\^{}{\{}-18{\}} erg/s/cm\^{}2, means that the galaxies in the sample are typically \~{}7 times less massive (median M{\_}* = 10\^{}{\{}9.5{\}} M{\_}sun) than previously studied z\~{}2 emission-line galaxies. Despite their lower mass, the galaxies have OIII/Hb ratios which are very similar to previously studied z\~{}2 galaxies and much higher than the typical emission-line ratios of local galaxies. The WFC3 grism allows for unique studies of spatial gradients in emission lines, and we stack the two-dimensional spectra of the galaxies for this purpose. In the stacked data the OIII emission line is more spatially concentrated than the Hb emission line with 98.1 confidence. We additionally stack the X-ray data (all sources are individually undetected), and find that the average L(OIII)/L(0.5-10 keV) ratio is intermediate between typical z\~{}0 obscured active galaxies and star-forming galaxies. Together the compactness of the stacked OIII spatial profile and the stacked X-ray data suggest that at least some of these low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies harbor weak active galactic nuclei.},

The line of nodes of the tilted disc precesses slowly in the retrograde direction, resulting in a photometric signal with a period slightly less than the orbital period. We use the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics to simulate a series of models of differing mass ratio and effective viscosity to determine the retrograde precession period and superhump period deficit ɛ- as a function of system mass ratio q. We tabulate our results and present fits to both ɛ- and ɛ+ versus q, as well as compare the numerical results with those compiled from the literature of negative superhump observations. One surprising result is that while we find negative superhumps most clearly in simulations with an accretion stream present, we also find evidence for negative superhumps in simulations in which we shut off the mass transfer stream completely, indicating that the origin of the photometric signal is more complicated than previously believed.},

	N2 = {This paper brings together, into a single unified notation, the multipole formalisms for gravitational radiation which various people have constructed. It also extends the results of previous workers. More specifically: Part One of this paper reviews the various scalar, vector, and tensor spherical harmonics used in the general relativity literature-including the Regge-Wheeler harmonics, the symmetric, trace-free ("STF") tensors of Sachs and Pirani, the Newman-Penrose spin-weighted harmonics, and the Mathews-Zerilli Clebsch-Gordan-coupled harmonics-which include "pure-orbital" harmonics and "pure-spin" harmonics. The relationships between the various harmonics are presented. Part One then turns attention to gravitational radiation. The concept of "local wave zone" is introduced to facilitate a clean separation of "wave generation" from "wave propagation." The generic radiation field in the local wave zone is decomposed into multipole components. The energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum in the waves are expressed as infinite sums of multipole contributions. Attention is then restricted to sources that admit a nonsingular, spacetime-covering de Donder coordinate system. (This excludes black holes.) In such a coordinate system the multipole moments of the radiation field are expressed as volume integrals over the source. For slow-motion systems, these source integrals are re-expressed as infinite power series in Lλ/≡(size of source)(reduced wavelength of waves). The slow-motion source integrals are then specialized to systems with weak internal gravity to yield (i) the standard Newtonian formulas for the multipole moments, (ii) the post-Newtonian formulas of Epstein and Wagoner, and (iii) post-post-Newtonian formulas. Part Two of this paper derives a multipole-moment wave-generation formalism for slow-motion systems with arbitrarily strong internal gravity, including systems that cannot be covered by de Donder coordinates. In this formalism one calculates, by any means, the source's instantaneous, near-zone, external gravitational field as a solution of the time-independent Einstein field equations. One then reads off of this near-zone field the source's instantaneous multipole moments; and one plugs those time-evolving moments into the standard radiation formulae given in Part One of this paper. As building blocks for this formalism, Part Two also does the following things: (1) In the linearized theory of gravity, for the vacuum exterior of an isolated system, it derives the general solution of the field equations (a result due to Sachs, Bergmann, and Pirani). (2) In full nonlinear general relativity, for the vacuum near-zone exterior of an isolated system, it derives the structure of the general solution of the Einstein field equations. That structure is expressed as a sum of products of multipole contributions. It also matches this near-zone field onto an outgoing-wave radiation field. (3) In full nonlinear general relativity, for the vacuum exterior of a stationary isolated system, (a) it presents a definition of multipole moments which meshes naturally with gravitational-wave theory; (b) it introduces the concept of "asymptotically Cartesian and mass centered" (ACMC) coordinate systems; and (c) it shows how to deduce the multipole moments of a source from the form of its metric in an ACMC coordinate system. As an example, the lowest few (l<=3) multipole moments of the Kerr metric are computed.},

We construct Newtonian equilibrium models of corotational white dwarf-neutron star (WDNS) binaries in circular orbit and find that these models terminate at the Roche limit. At this point the binary will undergo either stable mass transfer (SMT) and evolve on a secular time scale, or unstable mass transfer (UMT), which results in the tidal disruption of the WD. The path a given binary will follow depends primarily on its mass ratio. We analyze the fate of known WDNS binaries and use population synthesis results to estimate the number of LISA-resolved galactic binaries that will undergo either SMT or UMT. We model the quasistationary SMT epoch by solving a set of simple ordinary differential equations and compute the corresponding gravitational waveforms. Finally, we discuss in general terms the possible fate of binaries that undergo UMT and construct approximate Newtonian equilibrium configurations of merged WDNS remnants. We use these configurations to assess plausible outcomes of our future, fully relativistic simulations of these systems. If sufficient WD debris lands on the NS, the remnant may collapse, whereby the gravitational waves from the inspiral, merger, and collapse phases will sweep from LISA through LIGO frequency bands. If the debris forms a disk about the NS, it may fragment and form planets.},

The results bear many close similarities to the observed properties of Type I supernovae, especially their energetics, light curves, nucleosynthesis, and spectra. In this paper a class of "detonating white dwarfs" is explored. The final evolution of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binary systems undergoing mass exchange at rates in the range 10-9 to 10-8M{\_}sun;yr-1 is considered. Three models are constructed having initial carbon-oxygen core masses 0.5, 0.8, and 1.2 M{\_}sun; and accreting helium at rates of 10-8, 2×10-9, and 10-9M{\_}sun;yr-1, respectively. In all cases continued evolution leads to the accumulation of a thick helium layer surrounding the core, degenerate helium ignition, detonation and mass ejection. Detailed isotopic nucleosynthesis has also been computed for these models and implications for Galactic chemical evolution and γ-line astronomy are discussed. At present, the class of detonating models does not agree well with spectroscopic constraints upon common Type I events.},

The detonation grows toward spherical symmetry at late times. At these densities (rho approx. 107 to 108 g cm-3), either Ni-56 or nuclei of the Si-Ca group are the dominant products of the burning. The bulk yields are sensitive to the density of the star when the transition to detonation occurs.

	N2 = {We show that a White Dwarf-White Dwarf (WD-WD) binary with semi-major axis a=1-300 AU, which is orbited by a stellar mass outer perturber with a moderate pericenter r{\_}{\{}p, out{\}} \sim 3-10 x a, has a few percent chance of experiencing a head-on collision within \~{}5 Gyr. Such a perturber is sufficiently distant to allow the triple system to remain intact for millions of orbits while efficiently exchanging angular momentum with the WD-WD binary. In \~{} 5{\%} of the initial orientations, the inner orbit efficiently scans the (equal energy) phase space in the region of zero angular momentum. In these systems, the binary experiences increasingly closer, stochastic, pericenter approaches r{\_}p \~{} a/2N with the increasing number (N) of orbits elapsed. Within N\~{}10\^{}5(a/30AU) orbits, a collision is likely to occur. This is shown by performing \simten thousand 3-body integrations and is explained by simple analytic arguments. The collisions are conservatively restricted to "clean" collisions in which all passages prior to the collision are greater than 4R{\_}WD=4x10\^{}9cm. In particular, within the last single orbit, the pericenter changes from r{\_}p>4R{\_}WD to a collision value of r{\_}p<2R{\_}WD. The effects of tidal deformations and General Relativistic (GR) corrections are negligible in these scenarios. The WDs approach each other with a high velocity >3000 km/s and the collision is likely to detonate the WDs leading to a type Ia SNe. If a significant fraction of WDs reside in such triples, the rate of such collisions is as high as the SNe Ia rate, and it is possible that some or all type Ia SNe occur in this way. Such SNe have a unique gravitational wave signature, which will allow a decisive identification in the future.},

	N2 = {Thermonuclear explosions may arise in binary star systems in which a carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) accretes helium-rich material from a companion star. If the accretion rate allows a sufficiently large mass of helium to accumulate prior to ignition of nuclear burning, the helium surface layer may detonate, giving rise to an astrophysical transient. Detonation of the accreted helium layer generates shock waves that propagate into the underlying CO WD. This might directly ignite a detonation of the CO WD at its surface (an edge-lit secondary detonation) or compress the core of the WD sufficiently to trigger a CO detonation near the centre. If either of these ignition mechanisms works, the two detonations (helium and CO) can then release sufficient energy to completely unbind the WD. These 'double-detonation' scenarios for thermonuclear explosion of WDs have previously been investigated as a potential channel for the production of Type Ia supernovae from WDs of ˜1 M\&sun;. Here we extend our 2D studies of the double-detonation model to significantly less massive CO WDs, the explosion of which could produce fainter, more rapidly evolving transients. We investigate the feasibility of triggering a secondary core detonation by shock convergence in low-mass CO WDs and the observable consequences of such a detonation. Our results suggest that core detonation is probable, even for the lowest CO core masses that are likely to be realized in nature. To quantify the observable signatures of core detonation, we compute spectra and light curves for models in which either an edge-lit or compression-triggered CO detonation is assumed to occur. We compare these to synthetic observables for models in which no CO detonation was allowed to occur. If significant shock compression of the CO WD occurs prior to detonation, explosion of the CO WD can produce a sufficiently large mass of radioactive iron-group nuclei to significantly affect the light curves. In particular, this can lead to relatively slow post-maximum decline. If the secondary detonation is edge-lit, however, the CO WD explosion primarily yields intermediate-mass elements that affect the observables more subtly. In this case, near-infrared observations and detailed spectroscopic analysis would be needed to determine whether a core detonation occurred. We comment on the implications of our results for understanding peculiar astrophysical transients including SN 2002bj, SN 2010X and SN 2005E.},

These outcomes are surveyed for a range of white dwarf masses (0.7-1.1 M sun), accretion rates ((1-7) ×10-8 M sun yr-1), and initial white dwarf temperatures (0.01 and 1 L sun). The results are particularly sensitive to the convection that goes on during the last few minutes before the explosion. Unless this convection maintains a shallow temperature gradient and unless the density is sufficiently high, the accreted helium does not detonate. Below a critical helium ignition density, which we estimate to be (5-10) ×105 g cm-3, either helium novae or helium deflagrations result. The hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, light curves, and spectra of a representative sample of detonating and deflagrating models are explored. Some can be quite faint indeed, powered at peak for a few days by the decay of 48Cr and 48V. Only the hottest, most massive white dwarfs considered with the smallest helium layers, show reasonable agreement with the light curves and spectra of common Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). For the other models, especially those involving lighter white dwarfs, the helium shell mass exceeds 0.05 M sun and the mass of the 56Ni that is synthesized exceeds 0.01 M sun. These explosions do not look like ordinary SNe Ia or any other frequently observed transient.},

Accretion of the last several solar masses of helium occurs on a timescale of roughly a minute and provides a neutrino luminosity of approximately 1051-1052 ergs s \^{}{\{}-1{\}} . Neutrino annihilation, 0.01{\%}-0.1{\%} efficient, along the rotational axis then gives a baryon-loaded fireball of electron-positron pairs and radiation (about 1050 ergs total) whose beaming and relativistic interaction with the circumstellar material makes the GRB (see, e.g., Rees \& Meszaros). The useful energy can be greatly increased if energy can be extracted from the rotational energy of the black hole by magnetic interaction with the disk. Such events should occur at a rate comparable to that of merging neutron stars and black hole neutron star pairs and may be responsible for long complex GRBs but not short hard ones.},

In this paper, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the relatively neglected mergers of white dwarfs and black holes. During the merger, the white dwarf is tidally disrupted and sheared into an accretion disk. Nuclear reactions are followed, and the energy release is negligible. Peak accretion rates are \~{}0.05 M{\_}solar s\^{}-1 (less for lower mass white dwarfs) and last for approximately a minute. Many of the disk parameters can be explained by a simple analytic model that we derive and compare to our simulations. This model can be used to predict accretion rates for white dwarf and black hole (or neutron star) masses that are not simulated here. Although the mergers studied here create disks with larger radii and longer accretion times than those from the merger of double neutron stars, a larger fraction of the white dwarf's mass becomes part of the disk. Thus the merger of a white dwarf and a black hole could produce a long-duration GRB. The event rate of these mergers may be as high as 10\^{}-6 yr\^{}-1 per galaxy.},

Eleven of the twelve WDs are binaries with orbital periods shorter than 14 hr; the one non-variable WD is possibly a pole-on system among our non-kinematically selected targets. Our sample is unique: it is complete in a well-defined range of apparent magnitude and color. The orbital mass functions imply that the unseen companions are most likely other WDs, although neutron star companions cannot be excluded. Six of the eleven systems with orbital solutions will merge within a Hubble time due to the loss of angular momentum through gravitational wave radiation. The quickest merger is J0923+3028, a g = 15.7 ELM WD binary with a 1.08 hr orbital period and a <=130 Myr merger time. The chance of a supernova Ia event among our ELM WDs is only 1{\%}-7{\%}, however. Three binary systems (J0755+4906, J1233+1602, and J2119-0018) have extreme mass ratios and will most likely form stable mass-transfer AM CVn systems. Two of these objects, SDSS J1233+1602 and J2119-0018, are the lowest surface gravity WDs ever found; both show Ca II absorption likely from accretion of circumbinary material. We predict that at least one of our WDs is an eclipsing detached double WD system, important for constraining helium core WD models.

Particular attention is given to models of X-ray bursts that start with a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a neutron star and to the thin-shell helium instability of intermediate-mass stars. In the X-ray burst case, turbulent deflagrations propagating in the lateral or radial direction encounter a transition from the distributed regime to the flamelet regime at a density of \~{}108 g cm-3.

Similarly, the planar ZND detonation width becomes larger than the pressure scale height at \~{}107 g cm-3, suggesting that steady state, self-sustained detonations cannot come into existence in the radial direction. In the thin helium shell case, turbulent deflagrations traveling in the lateral or radial direction encounter the distributed regime at densities below \~{}107 g cm-3 and the flamelet regime at larger densities. In the radial direction, the purely laminar deflagration width is larger than the pressure scale height for densities smaller than \~{}104 g cm-3, indicating that steady state laminar deflagrations cannot form below this density.

Part of this population is expected to be eccentric, and here we investigate the potential for constraining the white dwarf (WD) properties through apsidal precession in these binaries. We analyze the tidal, rotational, and general relativistic contributions to apsidal precession by using detailed He WD models, where the evolution of the star's interior is followed throughout the cooling phase. In agreement with previous studies of zero-temperature WDs, we find that apsidal precession in eccentric DWDs can lead to a detectable shift in the emitted GW signal when binaries with cool (old) components are considered. This shift increases significantly for hot (young) WDs. We find that apsidal motion in hot (cool) DWDs is dominated by tides at orbital frequencies above >\~{} 10-4 Hz (10-3 Hz). The analysis of apsidal precession in these sources while ignoring the tidal component would lead to an extreme bias in the mass determination, and could lead us to misidentify WDs as neutron stars or black holes. We use the detailed WD models to show that for older, cold WDs, there is a unique relationship that ties the radius and apsidal precession constant to the WD masses, therefore allowing tides to be used as a tool to constrain the source masses.},

The (revised) line flux from \^{}44\^{}Ti decay in the Cas A supernova remnant reported by COMPTEL on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory is near the upper bound expected from our models. The necessary concurrent ejection of \^{}56\^{}Ni would also imply that Cas A was a brighter supernova than previously thought unless extinction in the intervening matter was very large. Thus, if confirmed, the reported amount of \^{}44\^{}Ti in Cas A provides very interesting constraints on both the supernova environment and its mechanism. The abundances of \^{}44\^{}Ti and \^{}60\^{}Co ejected by Type II supernovae are such that gamma-radiation from \^{}44\^{}Ti decay SN 1987A could be detected by a future generation of gamma- ray telescopes, and that the decay of \^{}60\^{}Co might provide an interesting contribution to the late-time light curve of SN 1987A and other core collapse supernovae. To produce the solar \^{}44\^{}Ca abundance and satisfy all the observational constraints, nature may prefer at least the occasional explosion of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs as Type Ia supernovae. Depending on the escape fraction of positrons due to \^{}56\^{}Co made in all kinds of Type Ia supernovae, a significant fraction of the steady state diffuse 511 keV emission may arise from the annihilation of positrons produced during the decay of \^{}44\^{}Ti to \^{}44\^{}Ca. The Ca and Ti isotopic anomalies in presolar grains confirm the production of \^{}44\^{}Ti in supernovae and that extensive mixing between zones has occurred, but a quantitative model for this mixing is presently lacking.},

	N2 = {We compare the yields of 44Ti and 56Ni produced from post-processing the thermodynamic trajectories from three different core-collapse models---a Cassiopeia A progenitor, a double shock hypernova progenitor, and a rotating two-dimensional explosion---with the yields from exponential and power-law trajectories. The peak temperatures and densities achieved in these core-collapse models span several of the distinct nucleosynthesis regions we identify, resulting in different trends in the 44Ti and 56Ni yields for different mass elements. The 44Ti and 56Ni mass fraction profiles from the exponential and power-law profiles generally explain the tendencies of the post-processed yields, depending on which regions are traversed by the model. We find that integrated yields of 44Ti and 56Ni from the exponential and power-law trajectories are generally within a factor two or less of the post-process yields. We also analyze the influence of specific nuclear reactions on the 44Ti and 56Ni abundance evolution. Reactions that affect all yields globally are the 3α, p(e-, νe)n and n(e\^{}{\{}+{\}},\overline{\{}ν{\_}e{\}})p. The rest of the reactions are ranked according to their degree of impact on the synthesis of 44Ti. The primary ones include 44Ti(α, p)47V, 40Ca(α, γ)44Ti, 45V(p, γ)46Cr, 40Ca(α, p)43Sc, 17F(α, p)20Ne, 21Na(α, p)24Mg, 41Sc(p, γ)42Ti, 43Sc(p, γ)44Ti, 44Ti(p, γ)45V, and 57Ni(p, γ)58Cu, along with numerous weak reactions. Our analysis suggests that not all 44Ti need to be produced in an α-rich freeze-out in core-collapse events, and that reaction rate equilibria in combination with timescale effects for the expansion profile may account for the paucity of 44Ti observed in supernova remnants.},

	N2 = {We explore the nucleosynthesis trends from two mechanisms during freeze-out expansions in core-collapse supernovae. The first mechanism is related to the convection and instabilities within homogeneous stellar progenitor matter that is accreted through the supernova shock. The second mechanism is related to the impact of the supersonic wind termination shock (reverse shock) within the tumultuous inner regions of the ejecta above the proto-neutron star. Our results suggest that isotopes in the mass range 12 <= A <= 122 that are produced during the freeze-out expansions may be classified in two families. The isotopes of the first family manifest a common mass fraction evolutionary profile, whose specific shape per isotope depends on the characteristic transition between two equilibrium states (equilibrium state transition) during each type of freeze-out expansion. The first family includes the majority of isotopes in this mass range. The second family is limited to magic nuclei and isotopes in their locality, which do not sustain any transition, become nuclear flow hubs, and dominate the final composition. We use exponential and power-law adiabatic profiles to identify dynamic large-scale and small-scale equilibrium patterns among nuclear reactions. A reaction rate sensitivity study identifies those reactions that are crucial to the synthesis of radioactivities in the mass range of interest. In addition, we introduce non-monotonic parameterized profiles to probe the impact of the reverse shock and multi-dimensional explosion asymmetries on nucleosynthesis. Cases are shown in which the non-monotonic profiles favor the production of radioactivities. Non-monotonic freeze-out profiles involve longer non-equilibrium nucleosynthesis intervals compared with the exponential and power-law profiles, resulting in mass fraction trends and yield distributions that may not be achieved by the monotonic freeze-out profiles.},

	N2 = {We determine the yields of the elements from Na to Ni for Type II supernovae (SNe II) and the yield patterns of the same elements for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and very massive (>\~{}100 Msolar) stars (VMSs) using a phenomenological model of stellar nucleosynthesis and the data on a number of stars with -4<\~{}{$[$}Fe/H{$]$}<\~{}-3, a single star with {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}=-2.04, and the Sun. We consider that there are two distinct kinds of SNe II: the high-frequency SNe II(H) and the low-frequency SNe II(L). We also consider that VMSs were the dominant first-generation stars formed from big bang debris. The yield patterns of Na to Ni for SNe II(H), II(L), and Ia and VMSs appear to be well defined. It is found that SNe II(H) produce almost none of these elements; that SNe II(L) can account for the entire solar inventory of Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and V; and that compared with SNe II(L), VMSs underproduce Na, Al, V, Cr, and Mn, overproduce Co, but otherwise have an almost identical yield pattern. A comparison is made between the yield patterns determined here from the observational data and those calculated from ab initio models of nucleosynthesis in SNe II and VMSs. We show that the evolution of the ``heavy'' elements in the universe relative to Fe involves three distinct stages. The earliest stage is in the domain of {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}<-3 and is governed by VMS activities with some small contributions from SNe II, all of which are dispersed in a dilution mass of MVMSdil\~{}106-107 Msolar. The beginning of the second stage is marked by the cessation of VMS activities and the onset of major formation of normal stars (with masses of \~{}1-60 Msolar) at {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}\~{}-3. The cessation of VMS activities causes the dilution mass for SN II contributions to drop sharply to MSNIIdil\~{}3×104 Msolar. The subsequent quasi-continuous chemical evolution until {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}\~{}-1 is governed by SNe II(H), which produce mainly the heavy r-process elements above Ba, and SNe II(L), which produce essentially all the other elements. The third stage starts with the onset of SN Ia contributions to mainly the Fe group elements at {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}\~{}-1. The domain of {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}>-1 is then governed by contributions from SNe II(H), II(L), and Ia and low-mass stars. It is shown that the abundances of non-neutron capture elements in stars with {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}<=0 and those of r-process elements in stars with {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}<-1 can be well represented by the sum of the distinct components in the phenomenological model. The proposed evolutionary sequence is directly related to the problems of early aggregation and dispersion of baryonic matter and to the onset of formation and chemical evolution of galaxies. It is argued that the prompt inventory governed by VMS contributions should represent the typical composition of dispersed baryonic matter in the universe, and that normal galactic evolution should begin in matter with {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}\~{}3.},

	N2 = {We present improved black hole masses for 35 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on a complete and consistent reanalysis of broad emission-line reverberation-mapping data. From objects with multiple line measurements, we find that the highest precision measure of the virial product cτΔV2/G, where τis the emission-line lag relative to continuum variations and ΔV is the emission-line width, is obtained by using the cross-correlation function centroid (as opposed to the cross-correlation function peak) for the time delay and the line dispersion (as opposed to FWHM) for the line width and by measuring the line width in the variable part of the spectrum. Accurate line-width measurement depends critically on avoiding contaminating features, in particular the narrow components of the emission lines. We find that the precision (or random component of the error) of reverberation-based black hole mass measurements is typically around 30{\%}, comparable to the precision attained in measurement of black hole masses in quiescent galaxies by gas or stellar dynamical methods. Based on results presented in a companion paper by Onken et al., we provide a zero-point calibration for the reverberation-based black hole mass scale by using the relationship between black hole mass and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion. The scatter around this relationship implies that the typical systematic uncertainties in reverberation-based black hole masses are smaller than a factor of 3. We present a preliminary version of a mass-luminosity relationship that is much better defined than any previous attempt. Scatter about the mass-luminosity relationship for these AGNs appears to be real and could be correlated with either Eddington ratio or object inclination.},

	N2 = {I review progress made in understanding the nature of the broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the role BLRs play in the AGN phenomenon. The high equivalent widths of the lines imply a high BLR covering factor, and the absence of clear evidence for absorption by the BLR means that the BLR has a flattened distribution and that we always view it near pole-on. The BLR gas is strongly self-shielding near the equatorial plane. Velocity-resolved reverberation mapping has long strongly excluded significant outflow of the BLR and shows instead that the predominant motions are Keplerian with large turbulence and a significant net inflow. The rotation and turbulence are consistent with the inferred geometry. The blueshifting of high-ionization lines is a consequence of scattering off inflowing material rather than the result of an outflowing wind. The rate of inflow of the BLR is sufficient to provide the accretion rate needed to power the AGN. Because the motions of the BLR are gravitationally dominated, and the BLR structure is very similar in most AGNs, consistent black hole masses can be determined. The good correlation between these estimates and masses predicted from the bulge luminosities of host galaxies provides strong support for the similarity of AGN continuum shapes and the correctness of the BLR picture presented. It is concluded that although many mysteries remain about the details of how AGNs work, a general overall picture of the torus and BLR is becoming clear.},

	N2 = {Theory and observations of the dominant thermal continuum emission in AGN are examined. After correction for reddening, the steady state AGN optical-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are very similar. The SEDs are dominated energetically by the ``big blue bump'' (BBB), but this bump never shows the nu(+1/3) spectrum predicted for a standard thin accretion disk with a (r-0.75) radial temperature gradient. Instead, the observed optical-UV SED implies a temperature gradient of r(-0.57) independent of the thickness of the disk. This means that there is some flow of heat outwards in the disk. The disk is large and the region emitting the optical continuum is as large as the inner broad-line region (BLR). Because optical variability is seen in all AGN on the light-crossing time of the BLR, variations must propagate close to the speed of light, rather than on dynamical timescales. This argues that the energy-generation mechanism is electromagnetic rather that hydrodynamic. Since the velocities are near the speed of light, there can be significant local anisotropy in the emission. The large rapid variations of the BBB imply that the magnetohydrodynamic energy generation is fundamentally unstable. Because of the inevitable radial temperature gradient in the accreting material, different spectral regions come predominantly from different radii, and variations in different spectral regions correspond to variability at different radii. This explains the frequently observed independence of X-ray and optical variations, cases of variability at lower energies leading variability at higher energies, and rapid changes in emission-line reverberation lags. Some observational tests of the local variability hypothesis are proposed.},

The models are relevant to stars which are accreting matter from a companion, to single stars in late stages of evolution, to stripped noninteracting remnants of binary star evolution, and to merging and merged degenerate dwarfs. For any given mass and choice of nuclear fuels, a sequence of models is constructed which differ with respect to the mass of the degenerate core and the envelope characteristics. Each sequence has at least three distinct branches: a degenerate dwarf branch along which envelope mass increases with decreasing luminosity, a plateau branch characterized by a very small envelope mass and by a nearly constant luminosity which reaches the maximum achievable value for the sequence, and an asymptotic giant branch which is at the lowest temperatures achievable and along which envelope mass decreases with increasing luminosity.},

	N2 = {AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn) binaries consist of a degenerate helium donor and a helium, C/O, or O/Ne white dwarf accretor, with accretion rates of \dot{\{}M{\}} = 10\^{}{\{}-13{\}}\--10\^{}{\{}-5{\}} \, M{\_}\odot \; yr\^{}{\{}-1{\}}. For accretion rates <10-6 M sun yr-1, the accreted helium ignites unstably, resulting in a helium flash. As the donor mass and \dot{\{}M{\}} decrease, the ignition mass increases and eventually becomes larger than the donor mass, yielding a "last-flash" ignition mass of lsim0.1 M sun. Bildsten et al. have predicted that the largest outbursts of these systems will lead to dynamical burning and thermonuclear supernovae. In this paper, we study the evolution of the He-burning shells in more detail. We calculate maximum achievable temperatures as well as the minimum envelope masses that achieve dynamical burning conditions, finding that AM CVn systems with accretors gsim0.8 M sun will undergo dynamical burning. Triple-αreactions during the hydrostatic evolution set a lower limit to the 12C mass fraction of 0.001-0.05 when dynamical burning occurs, but core dredge-up may yield 12C, 16O, and/or 20Ne mass fractions of \~{}0.1. Accreted 14N will likely remain 14N during the accretion and convective phases, but regardless of 14N's fate, the neutron-to-proton ratio at the beginning of convection is fixed until the onset of dynamical burning. During explosive burning, the 14N will undergo 14N(α, γ)18F(α, p)21Ne, liberating a proton for the subsequent 12C(p, γ)13N(α, p)16O reaction, which bypasses the relatively slow α-capture onto 12C. Future hydrodynamic simulations must include these isotopes, as the additional reactions will reduce the Zel'dovich-von Neumann-D{\"o}ring length, making the propagation of the detonation wave more likely.},

Here we present a fully three-dimensional simulation of a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses of 0.9 M \&sun; and 1.1 M \&sun; combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions. A well-tested combination of codes is used to study the system. We start with the dynamical inspiral phase and follow the subsequent thermonuclear explosion under the plausible assumption that a detonation forms in the process of merging. We then perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfer simulations to predict synthetic observables from the homologously expanding supernova ejecta. We find that synthetic color light curves of our merger, which produces about 0.62 M \&sun; of 56Ni, show good agreement with those observed for normal SNe Ia in all wave bands from U to K. Line velocities in synthetic spectra around maximum light also agree well with observations. We conclude that violent mergers of massive white dwarfs can closely resemble normal SNe Ia. Therefore, depending on the number of such massive systems available these mergers may contribute at least a small fraction to the observed population of normal SNe Ia.},

Corrected for the solar reflex motion and to the local standard of rest, the Galactic rest-frame velocity is 709 km s-1. We suggest that this star is the first example of a hypervelocity star ejected from the Galactic center, as predicted by Hills and later discussed by Yu \& Tremaine. The star's radial velocity vector points 174$\,^{\circ}$from the Galactic center. The star has {$[$}Fe/H{$]$}\~{}0, consistent with a Galactic center origin, and a travel time of <\~{}80 Myr from the Galactic center, consistent with its stellar lifetime. If the star is indeed traveling from the Galactic center, it should have a proper motion of \~{}0.3 mas yr-1 observable with the Space Interferometry Mission or the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics.

Specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surface brightness decompositions of the host galaxies of nine new AGNs imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. The surface brightness decompositions allow us to create "AGN-free" images of the galaxies, from which we measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measured through the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. We also incorporate 20 new reverberation-mapping measurements of the Hβtime lag, which is assumed to yield the average HβBLR radius. The final sample includes 41 AGNs covering four orders of magnitude in luminosity. The additions and updates incorporated here primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the R BLR-L relationship. The best fit to the relationship using a Bayesian analysis finds a slope of \alpha = 0.533\^{}{\{}+0.035{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.033{\}}, consistent with previous work and with simple photoionization arguments. Only two AGNs appear to be outliers from the relationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubt regarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. The scatter around the relationship is found to be 0.19 $\pm$0.02 dex, but would be decreased to 0.13 dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. A large fraction of the remaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distances to the AGN host galaxies. Our results help support the possibility that the R BLR-L relationship could potentially be used to turn the BLRs of AGNs into standardizable candles. This would allow the cosmological expansion of the universe to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a larger range of redshifts.},

	N2 = {A simple refinement is proposed to the Dibai method for determining black hole masses in type-1 thermal AGNs. Comparisons with reverberation mapping black hole masses and host galaxy bulge properties suggest that the method is accurate to +/- 0.15 dex. Contrary to what was thought when the black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion ("M - sigma") relationship was first discovered, it does not have a lower dispersion than the black hole mass - bulge luminosity ("M - L") relationship. The dispersion in the M - L relationship for AGNs decreases strongly with increasing black hole mass or bulge luminosity. This is naturally explained as a consequence of the black hole - bulge relationships being the result of averaging due to mergers. Simulations show that the decrease in dispersion in the M - L relationship with increasing mass is in qualitative agreement with being driven by mergers. The large scatter in AGN black hole masses at lower masses rules out significant AGN feedback. A non-causal origin of the correlations between black holes and bulges explains the frequent lack of supermassive black holes in late-type galaxies, and the lack of correlation of black hole mass with pseudo-bulges.},

Using a Monte Carlo fitting technique, we demonstrate that both PSDs are reminiscent of the PSD of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in the high/soft state, and specifically rule out a low/hard-state PSD shape in NGC 3227. This result demonstrates that, at least where variability is concerned, broad-line Seyferts with hard X-ray spectra (photon index Γ\~{} 1.6) are not simply the analogues of the low/hard state in BHXRBs, and the dichotomy of NLS 1 and broad-line Seyferts cannot be simply interpreted in terms of the two states. We show that the PSD normalization in NGC 3227 is strongly energy-dependent, with larger variability amplitudes at lower energies, unlike NGC 5506 which shows little energy dependence of variability. We demonstrate that this difference is caused by spectral pivoting of the continuum in NGC 3227 at high energies, which is probably also related to the large amplitude of variability seen in the 2-10 keV band in this active galactic nucleus (AGN). Using the new PSD data and new results in the literature, we replot the PSD break time-scale versus mass plot for all AGNs with PSD breaks measured so far, and demonstrate that higher accretion rate AGNs appear to have relatively shorter break time-scales for their black hole mass than lower accretion rate AGNs.},

Reverberation mapping uses the light travel-time delayed emission-line response to continuum variations to determine the size and kinematics of the emission-line region. We compile a sample of 17 Seyfert 1 galaxies and two quasars with reliable reverberation and spectroscopy data, twice the number available previously. The data provide strong evidence that the broad-line region (BLR) size (as measured by the lag of the emission-line luminosity after changes in the continuum) and the emission-line width measure directly the central mass: the virial assumption is tested with long-term UV and optical monitoring data on NGC 5548. Two methods are used to estimate the distance of the broad emission-line region from the ionizing source: the photoionization method (which is available for many AGNs but has large intrinsic uncertainties) and the reverberation method (which gives very reliable distances but is available for only a few objects). The distance estimate is combined with the velocity dispersion, derived from the broad Hβline width (in the photoionization method) or from the variable part (rms) of the line profile, in the reverberation-rms method, to estimate the virial mass. Comparing the central masses calculated with the reverberation-rms method to those calculated using a photoionization model, we find a highly significant, nearly linear correlation. This provides a calibration of the photoionization method on the objects with presently available reverberation data, which should enable mass estimates for all AGNs with measured Hβline width. We find that the correlation between the masses is significantly better than the correlation between the corresponding BLR sizes calculated by the two methods, which further supports the conclusion that both methods measure the mass of the central black hole . Comparing the BLR sizes given by the two methods also enables us to estimate the ionizing EUV luminosity Lion, which is not directly observable. Typically it is 10 times the monochromatic luminosity at 5100 {\AA}(Lv). The Eddington ratio for the objects in our sample is in the range Lv/LEdd\~{}0.001-0.03 and Lion/LEdd\~{}0.01-0.3.},

	N2 = {We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability (Balbus \& Hawley 1991) in an initially isothermal, vertically stratified accretion disk. The simulations are local in the plane of the disk, but are global in the vertical direction in the sense that the computational domain encompasses several scale heights. We find that the instability generates and maintains magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in stratified disks. The properties of the saturated, turbulent state are similar to those reported for nonstratified homogeneous boxes, e.g., the power-law spectral distribution is consistent with Kolmogorov. The angular momentum transport rate is proportional to the magnetic pressure; if the average rate is scaled to the equatorial pressure, as in a standard "α-disk" model, the constant of proportionality is α≲0.01 for most of our simulations. This value may be limited somewhat by the numerical resolution of our simulations. We find buoyancy does not play an important role as a saturation mechanism. The nonlinear evolution of disks that begin with a variety of initial magnetic field geometries and strengths is similar. In particular, models in which the most unstable wavelengths are initially well resolved saturate at and maintain roughly the same magnetic energy density, suggesting dynamo action in the disk. We use the simulations to study the effect of the instability on the vertical structure of magnetic accretion disks. After saturation, the disk consists of a weakly magnetized core surrounded by a strongly magnetized corona. Changing the vertical boundary conditions does not significantly alter this structure. The vertical flux of magnetic energy is small compared to the local magnetic energy generation and dissipation rates. The disk is stable to Parker and buoyancy modes. Models evolved with an adiabatic equation of state undergo substantial heating due to nonlinear dissipation, resulting in an increase in the scale height of the disk. The vertical structure produced by the instability, particularly the presence of a strongly magnetized corona, may have relevance to the production of MHD winds from disks.},

We obtained the spectra in a variability campaign carried out with the 9.2 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory. The integrated Balmer and helium (He I, II) emission lines are delayed by 3 to 33 light days to the optical continuum variations respectively. The outer wings of the line profiles respond much faster to continuum variations than the central regions. The comparison of the observed profile variations with model calculations of different velocity fields indicates an accretion disk structure of the broad line emitting region in Mrk 110. Comparing the velocity-delay maps of the different emission lines among each other a clear radial stratification in the BLR can be recognized. Furthermore, delays of the red line wings are slightly shorter than those of the blue wings. This indicates an accretion disk wind in the BLR of Mrk 110. We determine a central black hole mass of M = 1.8x 107 Msun. Because of the poorly known inclination angle of the accretion disk this is a lower limit only.

An increase in optical luminosity was accompanied by the appearance of a strong, abnormally broad He II 4,686-{\AA}emission line. The appearance of this line indicates the presence of a component of highly ionized gas that did not contribute to the optical spectrum before the increase in luminosity. The greater line width suggests that the gas producing the He II emission is much closer to the central object than the broad region. This observation may be the first direct evidence of the accretion onto a central object.},

We employ data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the 2.1 m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Taking advantage of the short-wavelength coverage, we are able to study the so-called big blue bump, the region in which the energy output peaks, in detail. Most objects exhibit a spectral break around 1100 {\AA}. Although this result is formally associated with large uncertainty for some objects, there is strong evidence in the data that the far-ultraviolet spectral region is below the extrapolation of the near-ultraviolet-optical slope, indicating a spectral break around 1100 {\AA}. We compare the behavior of our sample to those of non-LTE thin-disk models covering a range in black hole mass, Eddington ratio, disk inclination, and other parameters. The distribution of ultraviolet-optical spectral indices redward of the break and far-ultraviolet indices shortward of the break are in rough agreement with the models. However, we do not see a correlation between the far-ultraviolet spectral index and the black hole mass, as seen in some accretion disk models. We argue that the observed spectral break is intrinsic to AGNs, although intrinsic reddening as well as Comptonization can strongly affect the far-ultraviolet spectral index.

	N2 = {We monitored 23 quasars and Seyfert 1 galaxies on timescales of minutes, hours, days, weeks, 3 weeks, and 3 months. Observations were made in broad continuum bands of blue, yellow, and far-red light. We attained typical 1 σrelative flux uncertainties of 2{\%} through differential photometry of field stars in the same CCD frames as the active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In 77 intranight comparisons (23 in blue light, 2 in yellow, and 52 in red) on 20 different AGNs, we found no evidence for significant intranight optical variations. An upper limit for the amplitude of variability for this sample of AGNs on timescales of 1 hr or less was derived to be 0.03 mag. The shortest timescales for which variations were detected, with confidence greater than 99{\%}, were 25 hr in Mrk 79 and 27 hr in NGC 4151. Variations on even shorter timescales might have been missed, as we observed few AGNs over time intervals of less than 1 day. We found evidence for variability on timescales of 1-10 days in 11{\%} of the AGNs in both the blue and yellow filters, and 26{\%} of the AGNs in the red continuum. In fact, five of the six lowest luminosity AGNs were significantly variable in the red on a timescale of days. We found optical variability to be more common on a month-to-month timescale; detectable in 60{\%} of the AGNs in the blue filter and 40{\%} in the red filter. Averaging over all the variable objects in the three wave bands, the rms variation was 0.12 mag over 25 days and 0.21 mag over 75 days. We confirmed the overall trend for average variability amplitude to increase with timescale (from 1 to 100 days) by computing autocorrelation and structure functions. The average power density spectra of AGN fluctuations had a logarithmic slope \~{}-1.+/-0.5. The exceptions are the five low-luminosity Seyferts which varied rapidly in the red, displaying relatively flat power-density spectra of variability in that wave band. The fastest significant variations detected, on a timescale of days, are consistent with the dynamical (orbital) timescale of a black-hole accretion disk. Larger amplitude variations are observed on a timescale of 1 month, by which time the amplitude of the luminosity autocorrelation function has typically dropped to 0.5. This variability timescale is consistent with the predicted thermal timescale of accretion disks. The largest peak-to-peak changes observed were 0.3 mag in the red (NGC 4151) and 0.5 mag in the blue (MCG 8-11-11)-15 and 30 times our measurement uncertainties. When large variations were seen in one filter, they were usually detected, over the same interval and in the same sense, in other filters (12 out of 14 times). On timescales of months, the amplitude of blue variations is generally larger than that of the red. In many objects the amplitude difference is so large that the intrinsic spectrum of the active nucleus must have been bluer when brighter. The most rapid variations tend to occur in the least luminous AGNs. Luminosity was inversely correlated with the variability χ2 in the red filter (r=-0.47, significant at the 98{\%} probability level). Nonetheless, the luminosity dependence of variability is not strong. In fact, the amplitudes of variability that we measure on timescales of months extrapolate very well from those observed in quasar variability monitoring in the blue over timescales of years (although they are somewhat smaller than the variations measured in the ultraviolet). Those AGNs with the strongest Fe II emission lines were also marginally less likely to show strong variability (r=-0.39). There was little correlation between the incidence of variability and any other AGN property. These results suggest that the time variability of the nuclear continuum may be essentially similar in all Seyfert 1 galaxies, and that many apparent differences in their light curves are due to differences in sampling. We have examined the histograms of flux increases and decreases. This reveals, for example, whether or not the light curves would be statistically equivalent with their flux scales inverted. Averaged over all variable objects, the light curves have a nearly symmetric distribution of points above and below the mean flux level. Physically this indicates that the variations are not predominantly due to ``flares and outbursts,'' on the one hand, nor to ``eclipses and dropouts,'' on the other. The light curves are not a sum of impulsive ``shots'' superposed on a quiescent brightness level. We also plotted the flux-change histograms as a function of time interval. In general, the symmetry of flux increases and decreases does not depend on the observation interval, so the light curves would be statistically equivalent with their time axes reversed. A possible exception is made by the low-luminosity Seyferts with fast variations in the red. There is a marginal (3 σ) indication that their red luminosity rises more rapidly than it decays.},

	N2 = {The analysis of relativistically broadened X-ray spectral features from the inner accretion disk provides a powerful tool for measuring the spin of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, AGN spectra are often complex and careful analysis employing appropriate and self-consistent models is required if one has to obtain robust results. In this paper, we revisit the deep 2009 July Suzaku observation of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3783 in order to study in a rigorous manner the robustness of the inferred black hole spin parameter. Using Monte Carlo Markov chain techniques, we identify a (partial) modeling degeneracy between the iron abundance of the disk and the black hole spin parameter. We show that the data for NGC 3783 strongly require both supersolar iron abundance (Z Fe = 2-4 Z \&sun;) and a rapidly spinning black hole (a > 0.89). We discuss various astrophysical considerations that can affect the measured abundance. We note that, while the abundance enhancement inferred in NGC 3783 is modest, the X-ray analysis of some other objects has found extreme iron abundances. We introduce the hypothesis that the radiative levitation of iron ions in the innermost regions of radiation-dominated AGN disks can enhance the photospheric abundance of iron. We show that radiative levitation is a plausible mechanism in the very inner regions of high accretion rate AGN disks.},

We investigate the differential extinction for high-redshift sources caused by extragalactic dust along the line of sight. Future observations of type Ia supernovae up to z \~{} 2, e.g. by the proposed SNAP satellite, will allow the measurement of the properties of dust over cosmological distances. We show that 1{\%} relative spectrophotometric accuracy (or broadband photometry) in the wavelength interval 0.7-1.5 mu m is required to measure the extinction caused by ``grey'' dust down to delta m=0.02 mag. We also argue that the presence of grey dust is not necessarily inconsistent with the recent measurement of the brightness of a supernova at z=1.7 (SN 1997ff), in the absence of accurate spectrophotometric information of the supernova.},

	N2 = {To be in a long-lived configuration, the density in a fluid disk should be constant along streamlines to prevent compressional (PdV) work from being done cyclically around every orbit. In a pure Kepler potential, flow along aligned elliptical streamlines of constant eccentricity will satisfy this condition. For most density profiles, differential precession driven by the pressure gradient will destroy the alignment; however, in the razor-thin approximation there is a family of simple equilibria in which the precession frequency is the same at all radii. These disks may therefore be long-lived at significant eccentricities. The density can be made axisymmetric as r-->0 while maintaining the precession rate by relaxing the requirement of constancy along streamlines in an arbitrarily small transition region near the center. In the limit of small eccentricity, the models can be seen as acoustically perturbed axisymmetric disks, and the precession rate is shown to agree with linear theory. The perturbation is a traveling wave similar to an ocean wave, with the fluid rising and falling epicyclically in the gravitational field of the central mass. The expected emission-line profiles from the eccentric disks are shown to be strongly asymmetric in general and, in extreme cases, prone to misinterpretation as single narrow lines with significant velocity offsets.},

The predictions of these stability analyses agree satisfactorily with the results of numerical simulations of the fragmentation of discs and filaments. The predicted critical masses in some well-studied regions of star formation also agree with the typical masses of the observed dense cloud clumps, and, in order of magnitude, with the masses of the young stars.},

	N2 = {In the double-detonation scenario for Type Ia supernovae, it is suggested that a detonation initiates in a shell of helium-rich material accreted from a companion star by a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. This shell detonation drives a shock front into the carbon-oxygen white dwarf that triggers a secondary detonation in the core. The core detonation results in a complete disruption of the white dwarf. Earlier studies concluded that this scenario has difficulties in accounting for the observed properties of Type Ia supernovae since the explosion ejecta are surrounded by the products of explosive helium burning in the shell. Recently, however, it was proposed that detonations might be possible for much less massive helium shells than previously assumed (Bildsten et al.). Moreover, it was shown that even detonations of these minimum helium shell masses robustly trigger detonations of the carbon-oxygen core (Fink et al.). Therefore, it is possible that the impact of the helium layer on observables is less than previously thought. Here, we present time-dependent multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations for models with minimum helium shell mass and derive synthetic observables for both the optical and γ-ray spectral regions. These differ strongly from those found in earlier simulations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions in which more massive helium shells were considered. Our models predict light curves that cover both the range of brightnesses and the rise and decline times of observed Type Ia supernovae. However, their colors and spectra do not match the observations. In particular, their B - V colors are generally too red. We show that this discrepancy is mainly due to the composition of the burning products of the helium shell of the Fink et al. models which contain significant amounts of titanium and chromium. Using a toy model, we also show that the burning products of the helium shell depend crucially on its initial composition. This leads us to conclude that good agreement between sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions and observed Type Ia supernovae may still be feasible but further study of the shell properties is required.},

	N2 = {Several models for Type Ia-like supernova events rely on the production of a self-sustained detonation powered by nuclear reactions. In the absence of hydrogen, the fuel that powers these detonations typically consists of either pure helium (He) or a mixture of carbon and oxygen (C/O). Studies that systematically determine the conditions required to initiate detonations in C/O material exist, but until now no analogous investigation of He matter has been conducted. We perform one-dimensional reactive hydrodynamical simulations at a variety of initial density and temperature combinations and find critical length scales for the initiation of He detonations that range between 1 and 1010 cm. A simple estimate of the length scales over which the total consumption of fuel will occur for steady-state detonations is provided by the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) formalism. Our initiation lengths are consistently smaller than the corresponding CJ length scales by a factor of \~{}100, providing opportunities for thermonuclear explosions in a wider range of low-mass white dwarfs (WDs) than previously thought possible. We find that virialized WDs with as little mass as 0.24 M ⊙can be detonated, and that even less massive WDs can be detonated if a sizable fraction of their mass is raised to a higher adiabat. That the initiation length is exceeded by the CJ length implies that certain systems may not reach nuclear statistical equilibrium within the time it takes a detonation to traverse the object. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that incomplete burning will occur in the majority of He WD detonations and that 40Ca, 44Ti, or 48Cr, rather than 56Ni, is the predominant burning product for many of these events. We anticipate that a measure of the quantity of the intermediate-mass elements and 56Ni produced in a helium-rich thermonuclear explosion can potentially be used to constrain the nature of the progenitor system.},

The red giant is modeled as a massive core surrounded by a gaseous envelope, while the impactor, assumed to be a white dwarf or a main-sequence star, is treated as a single particle. Encounters at various impact parameters and with relative velocities pertinent to global clusters are studied. It is found that, if the impactor passes within twice the radius of the red giant, mass loss occurs from the red giant envelope and both objects are left bound in elliptical orbits. Calculations suggest that if the impactor has an initial distance at the closest approach of approximately 1.6 R(RG) or less, the impactor will spiral into the red giant envelope on subsequent periastron passages. For bound systems with a greater separation, the orbit may circularize with a radius approximately double that of the initial counter.},

However, the nonlinear density functions encountered in these problems can make MCMC time-consuming. In this paper, we apply an ensemble sampler respecting affine invariance to orbital parameter extraction from radial velocity data. This new sampler has only one free parameter, and does not require much tuning for good performance, which is important for automatization. The autocorrelation time of this sampler is approximately the same for all parameters and far smaller than Metropolis-Hastings, which means it requires many fewer function calls to produce the same number of independent samples. The affine-invariant sampler speeds up MCMC by hundreds of times compared with Metropolis-Hastings in the same computing situation. This novel sampler would be ideal for projects involving large data sets such as statistical investigations of planet distribution. The biggest obstacle to ensemble samplers is the existence of multiple local optima; we present a clustering technique to deal with local optima by clustering based on the likelihood of the walkers in the ensemble. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the sampler on real radial velocity data.},

Our work focuses on studying the potential contribution from relativistic disc reflection and examining the implications of this interpretation for the intrinsic spectral complexities frequently displayed by AGN in the X-ray bandpass. During the analysis, we take the unique approach of attempting to simultaneously undertake a systematic analysis of the whole sample, as well as a detailed treatment of each individual source, and find that disc reflection has the required flexibility to successfully reproduce the broad-band spectrum observed for all of the sources considered. Where possible, we use the reflected emission to place constraints on the black hole spin for this sample of sources. Our analysis suggests a general preference for rapidly rotating black holes, which if taken at face value is most consistent with the scenario in which supermassive black hole growth is dominated by prolonged, ordered accretion. However, there may be observational biases towards AGN with high spin in the compiled sample, limiting our ability to draw strong conclusions for the general population at this stage. Finally, contrary to popular belief, our analysis also implies that the dichotomy between radio-loud/radio-quiet AGN is not solely related to black hole spin.},

Drawing from the observed properties of non-conservative mass transfer among accreting white dwarfs, we use these limits on the density of the immediate environs to exclude a phase space of possible progenitor systems for SN 2011fe. We rule out a symbiotic progenitor system and also a system characterized by high accretion rate onto the white dwarf that is expected to give rise to optically thick accretion winds. Assuming that a small fraction, 1{\%}, of the mass accreted is lost from the progenitor system, we also eliminate much of the potential progenitor parameter space for white dwarfs hosting recurrent novae or undergoing stable nuclear burning. Therefore, we rule out much of the parameter space associated with popular single degenerate progenitor models for SN 2011fe, leaving a limited phase space largely inhabited by some double degenerate systems, as well as exotic single degenerates with a sufficient time delay between mass accretion and SN explosion.},

There are two classes of models: double-degenerate (involving two white dwarfs in a close binary system) and single-degenerate models. In the latter, the primary white dwarf accretes material from a secondary companion until conditions are such that carbon ignites, at a mass of 1.38 times the mass of the Sun. The type Ia supernova SN 2011fe was recently detected in a nearby galaxy. Here we report an analysis of archival images of the location of SN 2011fe. The luminosity of the progenitor system (especially the companion star) is 10-100 times fainter than previous limits on other type Ia supernova progenitor systems, allowing us to rule out luminous red giants and almost all helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the exploding white dwarf.},

	N2 = {A type Ia supernova is thought to begin with the explosion of a white dwarf star. The explosion could be triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs (a `double-degenerate' origin), or by mass transfer from a companion star (the `single-degenerate' path). The identity of the progenitor is still controversial; for example, a recent argument against the single-degenerate origin has been widely rejected. One way to distinguish between the double- and single-degenerate progenitors is to look at the centre of a known type Ia supernova remnant to see whether any former companion star is present. A likely ex-companion star for the progenitor of the supernova observed by Tycho Brahe has been identified, but that claim is still controversial. Here we report that the central region of the supernova remnant SNR 0509-67.5 (the site of a type Ia supernova 400+/-50 years ago, based on its light echo) in the Large Magellanic Cloud contains no ex-companion star to a visual magnitude limit of 26.9 (an absolute magnitude of MV = +8.4) within a region of radius 1.43 arcseconds. (This corresponds to the 3σmaximum distance to which a companion could have been `kicked' by the explosion.) This lack of any ex-companion star to deep limits rules out all published single-degenerate models for this supernova. The only remaining possibility is that the progenitor of this particular type Ia supernova was a double-degenerate system.},

These instabilities can lead to viscous evolution on a time-scale short compared to the thermal evolution of the remnant. We present multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of WD merger remnants under the action of an α-viscosity. We initialize our calculations using the output of eight WD merger simulations from Dan et al., which span a range of mass ratios and total masses. We generically find that the merger remnants evolve towards spherical states on time-scales of hours, even though a significant fraction of the mass is initially rotationally supported. The viscous evolution unbinds only a very small amount of mass (≲10-5 M). Viscous heating causes some of the systems we study with He WD secondaries to reach conditions of nearly-dynamical burning. It is thus possible that the post-merger viscous phase triggers detonation of the He envelope in some WD mergers, potentially producing a Type Ia supernova via a double-detonation scenario. Our calculations provide the proper initial conditions for studying the long-term thermal evolution of WD merger remnants. This is important for understanding WD mergers as progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, neutron stars, R Coronae Borealis stars and other phenomena.},

Using Ks -band Two Micron All Sky Survey data, we find the near-linear relation M bhvpropL 1.10 $\pm$0.20 Ks for the core-S{\'e}rsic spheroids thought to be built in additive dry merger events, while we find the relation M bhvpropL 2.73 $\pm$0.55 Ks for the S{\'e}rsic spheroids built from gas-rich processes. After converting literature B-band disk galaxy magnitudes into inclination- and dust-corrected bulge magnitudes, via a useful new equation presented herein, we obtain a similar result. Unlike with the M bh-(velocity dispersion) diagram, which is also updated here using the same galaxy sample, it remains unknown whether barred and non-barred S{\'e}rsic galaxies are offset from each other in the M bh-L diagram. While black hole feedback has typically been invoked to explain what was previously thought to be a nearly constant M bh/M Spheroid mass ratio of \~{}0.2{\%}, we advocate that the near-linear M bh-L and M bh-M Spheroid relations observed at high masses may have instead arisen largely from the additive dry merging of galaxies. We argue that feedback results in a dramatically different scaling relation, such that black hole mass scales roughly quadratically with the spheroid mass in S{\'e}rsic galaxies. We therefore introduce a revised cold-gas "quasar" mode feeding equation for semi-analytical models to reflect what we dub the quadratic growth of black holes in S{\'e}rsic galaxies built amidst gas-rich processes. Finally, we use our new S{\'e}rsic M bh-L equations to predict the masses of candidate intermediate mass black holes in almost 50 low-luminosity spheroids containing active galactic nuclei, finding many masses between that of stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes.},

The scenario is simulated numerically to give results of the gasdynamical event: all C-O fuel is burned; intermediate mass elements are produced in the outer layers; and approximately 1 solar mass or more of Fe-peak elements is produced during a delayed detonation. The results are compared to both detonation and deflagration models to consider the velocities of intermediate mass elements and of Fe-peak elements.

The main parameters of the models considered are the initial density at the center, the ratio of the deflagration wave velocity and the velocity of sound ahead of the wave, and the density ahead of the deflagration wave at which the transition from a deflagration to a detonation occurs. For thermonuclear models of Type Ia supernovae, the limitations on the deflagration wave velocity near the center, Ddef is less than approximately 0.03 a(s), and on the central density of an exploding white dwarf, rho(c) is less than approximately 2-2.5 10 to the 9th g/cu cm, are obtained. It is suggested that the transition from a deflagration to a detonation in the DD models occurs due to both the turbulence in the vicinity of the flame front and the strong pulsation of the dwarf during the explosion.},

We model the reverberation mapping data directly, constraining the geometry and kinematics of the BLR, as well as deriving a black hole mass estimate that does not depend on a normalizing factor or virial coefficient. We find that the geometry of the BLR in Mrk 50 is a nearly face-on thick disk, with a mean radius of 9.6+1.2 -0.9 light days, a width of the BLR of 6.9+1.2 -1.1 light days, and a disk opening angle of 25 $\pm$10 deg above the plane. We also constrain the inclination angle to be 9+7 -5 deg, close to face-on. Finally, the black hole mass of Mrk 50 is inferred to be log10(M BH/M \&sun;) = 7.57+0.44 -0.27. By comparison to the virial black hole mass estimate from traditional reverberation mapping analysis, we find the normalizing constant (virial coefficient) to be log10 f = 0.78+0.44 -0.27, consistent with the commonly adopted mean value of 0.74 based on aligning the M BH-σ* relation for active galactic nuclei and quiescent galaxies. While our dynamical model includes the possibility of a net inflow or outflow in the BLR, we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.},

This work is an extension of the earlier work presented by Proga, in which nonrotating flows were studied. Here, we consider effects of rotation, a position-dependent radiation temperature, density at large radii, and uniform X-ray background radiation. As in the nonrotating case, the rotating flow settles into a configuration with two components, (1) an equatorial inflow and (2) a bipolar inflow/outflow with the outflow leaving the system along the pole. However, with rotation the flow does not always reach a steady state. In addition, rotation reduces the outflow collimation and the outward flux of mass and kinetic energy. Moreover, rotation increases the outward flux of the thermal energy and can lead to fragmentation and time variability of the outflow. We also show that a position-dependent radiation temperature can significantly change the flow solution. In particular, the inflow in the equatorial region can be replaced by a thermally driven outflow. Generally, as has been discussed and shown in the past, we find that self-consistently determined preheating/cooling from the quasar radiation can significantly reduce the rate at which the central BH is fed with matter. However, our results also emphasize a little-appreciated feature. Namely, quasar radiation drives a nonspherical, multitemperature, and very dynamic flow. These effects become dominant for luminosities in excess of 0.01 of the Eddington luminosity.},

I argue that bremsstrahlung emission accounts for most of the ``quiescent'' (nonflaring) flux observed by Chandra from Sgr A*; this emission is spatially extended on scales \~{}RA\~{}1" and has a relatively soft spectrum, as is observed. If accretion onto the central black hole proceeds via a Bondi or ADAF flow, a hard X-ray power law should be present in deeper observations with a flux \~{}1/3 of the soft X-ray flux; nondetection of this hard X-ray component would argue against ADAF/Bondi models.

When nonequilibrium ionization plays a significant role the ionization states deviate from those that obtain in collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE), and the local cooling efficiency at any given temperature depends on specific nonequilibrium ion fractions. The results presented here allow for an efficient estimate of the total cooling efficiency for any ionic composition. We also list the elemental cooling efficiencies assuming CIE conditions. These can be used to construct CIE cooling efficiencies for non-solar abundance ratios or to estimate the cooling due to elements not included in any nonequilibrium computation.

BH masses based only on the virial product ΔV2R and neglecting the effect of radiation pressure can be severely underestimated, especially in objects close to the Eddington limit. We provide an empirical calibration of the correction for radiation pressure, and we show that it is consistent with a simple physical model in which BLR clouds are optically thick to ionizing radiation and have average column densities of NH\~{}1023 cm-2. This value is remarkably similar to what is required in standard BLR photoionization models to explain observed spectra. With the inclusion of radiation pressure, the discrepancy between virial BH masses based on single-epoch spectra and on reverberation mapping data drops from 0.4 to 0.2 dex rms. The use of single-epoch observations as surrogates of reverberation mapping campaigns can thus provide more accurate BH masses than previously thought. Finally, we show that narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies have apparently low BH masses because they are radiating close to their Eddington limit. After the radiation pressure correction, NLS1 galaxies have BH masses similar to other broad-line AGNs and follow the same MBH-σe/Lsph relations as other active and normal galaxies. Radiation forces arising from ionizing photon momentum deposition constitute an important physical effect which must be taken into account when computing virial BH masses.},

In order to determine the black hole mass in Zw 229-015 from Hβreverberation mapping, we have carried out nightly observations with the Kast Spectrograph at the Lick 3 m telescope during the dark runs from 2010 June through December, obtaining 54 spectroscopic observations in total. We have also obtained nightly V-band imaging with the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory and with the 0.9 m telescope at the Brigham Young University West Mountain Observatory over the same period. We detect strong variability in the source, which exhibited more than a factor of two change in broad Hβflux. From cross-correlation measurements, we find that the Hβlight curve has a rest-frame lag of 3.86+0.69 -0.90 days with respect to the V-band continuum variations. We also measure reverberation lags for Hαand Hγand find an upper limit to the Hδlag. Combining the Hβlag measurement with a broad Hβwidth of σline = 1590 $\pm$47 km s-1 measured from the rms variability spectrum, we obtain a virial estimate of M BH = 1.00+0.19 -0.24 ×107 M sun for the black hole in Zw 229-015. As a Kepler target, Zw 229-015 will eventually have one of the highest-quality optical light curves ever measured for any active galaxy, and the black hole mass determined from reverberation mapping will serve as a benchmark for testing relationships between black hole mass and continuum variability characteristics in active galactic nuclei.},

We derive galaxy surface brightness and colour profiles out to large galactocentric radii. We compare the latter to metallicities derived using the near-infrared Calcium Triplet. We obtain stellar kinematics out to ˜3.5 effective radii. The latter appear flattened or elongated beyond ˜1.8 effective radii in contrast to the relatively round photometric isophotes. In fact, NGC 4494 may be a flattened galaxy, possibly even an S0, seen at an inclination of ˜45$\,^{\circ}$. We publish a catalogue of 431 GC candidates brighter than i0= 24 based on the photometry, of which 109 are confirmed spectroscopically and 54 have measured spectroscopic metallicities. We also report the discovery of three spectroscopically confirmed ultra-compact dwarfs around NGC 4494 with measured metallicities of -0.4 ≲{$[$}Fe/H{$]$}≲-0.3. Based on their properties, we conclude that they are simply bright GCs. The metal-poor GCs are found to be rotating with similar amplitude as the galaxy stars, while the metal-rich GCs show marginal rotation. We supplement our analysis with available literature data and results. Using model predictions of galaxy formation, and a suite of merger simulations, we find that many of the observational properties of NGC 4494 may be explained by formation in a relatively recent gas-rich major merger. Complete studies of individual galaxies incorporating a range of observational avenues and methods such as the one presented here will be an invaluable tool for constraining the fine details of galaxy formation models, especially at large galactocentric radii.},

	N2 = {Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we have found that the weak-field magnetorotational instability constitutes a hydromagnetic dynamo in astrophysical disks. The field amplification mechanism lies outside the scope of kinematic dynamo theory and implies that kinematic dynamo theory is not applicable to accretion disk systems. We begin with simulations of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence to demonstrate the ability of our finite-difference code to reproduce known dynamos. To calibrate our code, we measure magnetic field rates when the turbulent velocity field is not sustained through external forcing. When the turbulence is maintained with imposed velocity fields, a magnetic dynamo can be produced. Two cases are considered: velocity fields with and without net helicity. Both the helical and the nonhelical velocity fields amplify and sustain magnetic fields despite substantial turbulent dissipation. The nonhelical dynamo increases the magnetic field energy by an order of magnitude. The helical dynamo produces greater amplification (a factor of 30 in energy) and a more ordered field. Lorentz forces eventually limit the growth of the magnetic field in both cases. We next carry out simulations in the local shearing box model of an accretion disk. The initial magnetic field has a mean field value of zero over the computational domain and is weak in the sense that the initial Alfv{\'e}n speed is much less than the sound speed. The magnetorotational instability rapidly generates turbulence within the disk. The turbulence is anisotropic, producing significant Maxwell and Reynolds stresses that transport angular momentum outward. Both the stresses and magnetic energy density remain subthermal and do not approach equipartition. The magnetic energy is amplified by a factor of 20 and maintained for over 200 orbits of time, far longer than the magnetic decay time in the absence of an amplification mechanism. A parameter survey indicates the final turbulent state does not depend on the initial average field strength; some dependence on the computational domain size, magnetic Prandtl number, and numerical resolution is observed. Finally, we demonstrate explicitly that more than shear and turbulence are required to produce dynamo amplification of magnetic fields.},

Some fraction of this gas is predicted to be blown away from the BH, producing an optically bright flare of radiation. We predict the spectra and spectral evolution of tidal disruption events, focusing on the signatures produced by photoionized gas outside the photosphere of this super-Eddington outflow. We show that the spectrum of such an outflow should show absorption lines that are strongly blueshifted relative to the host galaxy, are typically very broad (0.01-0.1c) and are most prominent at ultraviolet wavelengths (e.g. C IV, Lyman α, O VI) at early times (≲1 month for a ˜106 M\&sun; BH). There may also be optical absorption lines of hydrogen and He II if there is a lower velocity component to the outflow (≲0.01c). At later times, the outflow falls out of thermal equilibrium and the continuum emission likely hardens - the absorption lines will then primarily be in the soft X-rays. Supernovae in galactic nuclei are a significant source of confusion in optical surveys for tidal disruption events: we estimate that nuclear Type Ia supernovae are two orders of magnitude more common than tidal disruption events at z˜0.1 for ground-based surveys. Nuclear Type II supernovae occur at a comparable rate but can be excluded by pre-selecting red galaxies. The contamination from nuclear supernovae can be reduced to a manageable level by using high-resolution follow-up imaging with adaptive optics or the Hubble Space Telescope. Our predictions should help optical transient surveys capitalize on their potential for discovering tidal disruption events.},

Only seven of the 23 systems have spectral differences consistent with no differential extinction. The median differential extinction for the optically selected (radio-selected) subsample is DeltaE(B-V)=0.04 (0.06) mag. The extinction is patchy and shows no correlation with impact parameter. The median total extinction of the bluest images is E(B-V)=0.08 mag, although the total extinction distribution is dominated by the uncertainties in the intrinsic colors of quasars. The directly measured extinction distributions are consistent with the mean extinction estimated by comparing the statistics of quasar and radio lens surveys, thereby confirming the need for extinction corrections when using the statistics of lensed quasars to estimate the cosmological model. A disjoint subsample of two face-on, radio-selected spiral lenses shows both high differential and total extinctions, but standard dust-to-gas ratios combined with the observed molecular gas column densities overpredict the amount of extinction by factors of 2-5. For several systems we can estimate the extinction law, ranging from R{\_}V=1.5+/-0.2 for a z{\_}l=0.96 elliptical, to R{\_}V=7.2+/-0.1 for a z{\_}l=0.68 spiral. For the four radio lenses where we can construct nonparametric extinction curves, we find no evidence for gray dust over the IR-UV wavelength range. The dust can be used to estimate lens redshifts with reasonable accuracy, although we sometimes find two degenerate redshift solutions.},

	N2 = {We present a detailed discussion of our new 3D numerical models for the accretion of stellar winds on to Sgr A*. In our most sophisticated models, we put stellar wind sources on realistic orbits around Sgr A*, we include recently discovered `slow' winds (vw\~{} 300kms-1), and we account for optically thin radiative cooling. We test our approach by first modelling only one-phase `fast' stellar winds (vw\~{} 1000kms-1). For stellar wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is of the order of , fluctuates by <\~{}10 per cent, and is in good agreement with previous models. In contrast, decreases by an order of magnitude for wind sources following circular orbits, and fluctuates by \~{}50 per cent. Then we allow a fraction of stars to produce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively after being shocked, forming cold clumps and filaments immersed into the X-ray-emitting gas. We investigate two orbital configurations for the stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs with perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive to the orbital distribution of the stars. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, producing a quasi-steady `floor' in the accretion rate, of the order of \~{}3 ×10-6Msolaryr-1, consistent with the values deduced from Chandra observations. The cold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful accretion episodes, which may give rise to large-amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. The circularization radii for the flows are about 103 and 104 Schwarzschild radii, for the one- and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never forming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work. Our work suggests that, averaged over time-scales of hundreds to thousands of years, the radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher than it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion modelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the wind velocities, mass-loss rates and stellar orbits.},

	N2 = {We have carried out a detailed binary population synthesis (BPS) study of the formation of subdwarf B (sdB) stars and related objects (sdO, sdOB stars) using the latest version of the BPS code developed by Han and co-workers. We systematically investigate the importance of the five main evolutionary channels in which the sdB stars form after one or two common-envelope (CE) phases, one or two phases of stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) or as the result of the merger of two helium white dwarfs (WDs). Our best BPS model can satisfactorily explain the main observational characteristics of sdB stars, in particular their distributions in the orbital period-minimum companion mass (log P-Mcomp) diagram and in the effective temperature-surface gravity (Teff-logg) diagram, their distributions of orbital period, log(gθ4) (θ= 5040 K /Teff) and mass function, their binary fraction and the fraction of sdB binaries with WD companions, their birth rates and their space density. We obtain a Galactic formation rate for sdB stars of 0.014-0.063 yr-1 with a best estimate of \~{}0.05 yr-1 and a total number in the Galaxy of 2.4-9.5 ×106 with a best estimate of \~{}6 ×106; half of these may be missing in observational surveys owing to selection effects. The intrinsic binary fraction is 76-89 per cent, although the observed frequency may be substantially lower owing to the selection effects. The first CE ejection channel, the first stable RLOF channel and the merger channel are intrinsically the most important channels, although observational selection effects tend to increase the relative importance of the second CE ejection and merger channels. We also predict a distribution of masses for sdB stars that is wider than is commonly assumed and that some sdB stars have companions of spectral type as early as B. The percentage of A-type stars with sdB companions can in principle be used to constrain some of the important parameters in the binary evolution model. We conclude that (i) the first RLOF phase needs to be more stable than is commonly assumed, either because the critical mass ratio qcrit for dynamical mass transfer is higher or because of tidally enhanced stellar wind mass loss; (ii) mass transfer in the first stable RLOF phase is non-conservative, and the mass lost from the system takes away a specific angular momentum similar to that of the system; and (iii) common-envelope ejection is very efficient.},

Previous studies of carbon-oxygen detonation structure and stability at low densities were performed under the assumption that the velocity of a detonation wave is derived from complete burning of carbon and oxygen to iron. In fact, at densities ρ<= 106 g cm-3 the detonation in SNe Ia may release less than a half of the available nuclear energy. In this paper, we study basic properties of such detonations. We find that the length of an unsupported steady-state C-detonation is sime30-100 times greater than previously estimated and that the decreased energy has a drastic effect on the detonation stability. In contrast to complete detonations which are one-dimensionally stable, C-detonations may be one-dimensionally unstable and propagate by periodically re-igniting themselves via spontaneous burning. The re-ignition period at ρ<= 106 g cm-3 is estimated to be greater than the timescale of an SN Ia explosion. This suggests that propagation and quenching of C-detonations at these densities could be affected by the instability. Potential observational implications of this effect are discussed.},

This census of galactic WR stars reaches 227 stars, comprising 127 WN stars, 87 WC stars, 10 WN/WC stars and 3 WO stars. This includes 15 WNL and 11 WCL stars within 30 pc of the Galactic Center. We compile and discuss WR spectral classification, variability, periodicity, binarity, terminal wind velocities, correlation with open clusters and OB associations, and correlation with Hi bubbles, Hii regions and ring nebulae. Intrinsic colours and absolute visual magnitudes per subtype are re-assessed for a re-determination of optical photometric distances and galactic distribution of WR stars. In the solar neighbourhood we find projected on the galactic plane a surface density of 3.3 WR stars per kpc2, with a WC/WN number ratio of 1.5, and a WR binary frequency (including probable binaries) of 39{\%}. The galactocentric distance (RWR) distribution per subtype shows RWR increasing with decreasing WR subtype, both for the WN and WC subtypes. This RWR distribution allows for the possibility of WNE-->WCE and WNL-->WCL subtype evolution.},

Our work allows the spectroscopic detection of early- and late-type stars to mK >= 16, more than 2 mag deeper than our previous data sets. Our observations result in a total sample of 177 bona fide early-type stars. We find that most of these Wolf Rayet (WR), O-, and B-stars reside in two strongly warped disks between 0farcs8 and 12'' from Sgr A*, as well as a central compact concentration (the S-star cluster) centered on Sgr A*. The later type B-stars (mK >15) in the radial interval between 0farcs8 and 12'' seem to be in a more isotropic distribution outside the disks. The observed dearth of late-type stars in the central few arcseconds is puzzling, even when allowing for stellar collisions. The stellar mass function of the disk stars is extremely top heavy with a best-fit power law of dN/dm vprop m -0.45$\pm$0.3. WR/O-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event \~{}6 Myr ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (IMF). The mass functions of the S-stars inside 0farcs8 and of the early-type stars at distances beyond 12'' are compatible with a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF (best-fit power law of dN/dm vprop m -2.15$\pm$0.3).

In this paper, we report the detections of five new stellar SiO masers within 50" (2 pc) of Sgr A* and new and/or improved positions and proper motions of 15 stellar SiO masers. The current accuracies are \~{}1 mas in position and \~{}0.3 mas yr-1 in proper motion. We find that the proper motion of the central stellar cluster with respect to Sgr A* is less than 45 km s-1. One star, IRS 9, has a three-dimensional speed of \~{}370 km s -1 at a projected distance of 0.33 pc from Sgr A*. If IRS 9 is bound to the inner parsec, this requires an enclosed mass that exceeds current estimates of the sum of the mass of Sgr A* and luminous stars in the stellar cusp by \~{}0.8×106 Msolar. Possible explanations include: (1) that IRS 9 is not bound to the central parsec and has ``fallen'' from a radius greater than 9 pc, (2) that a cluster of dark stellar remnants accounts for some of the excess mass, and/or (3) that R0 is considerably greater than 8 kpc.},

	N2 = {Aims: We aim at a detailed description of the kinematic properties of the old, (several Gyrs) late-type CO-absorption star population among the Galactic centre (GC) cluster stars. This cluster is composed of a central supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) and a self-gravitating system of stars. Understanding its kinematics thus offers the opportunity to understand the dynamical interaction between a central point mass and the surrounding stars in general, especially in view of understanding other galactic nuclei. Methods: We applied AO-assisted, near-infrared imaging and integral-field spectroscopy using the instruments NAOS/CONICA and SINFONI at the VLT. We obtained proper motions for 5445 stars, 3D velocities for 664 stars, and acceleration limits (in the sky plane) for 750 stars. Global kinematic properties were analysed using velocity and velocity dispersion distributions, phase-space maps, two-point correlation functions, and the Jeans equation. Results: We detect for the first time significant cluster rotation in the sense of the general Galactic rotation in proper motions. Out of the 3D velocity dispersion, we derive an improved statistical parallax for the GC of R0 = 8.07 $\pm$0.32{\_}stat $\pm$0.13{\_}sys kpc. The distribution of 3D stellar speeds can be approximated by local Maxwellian distributions. Kinematic modelling provides deprojected 3D kinematic parameters, including the mass profile of the cluster. We find an upper limit of 4{\%} for the amplitude of fluctuations in the phase-space distribution of the cluster stars compared to a uniform, spherical model cluster. Using upper limits on accelerations, we constrain the minimum line-of-sight distances from the plane of Sgr A* of five stars located within the innermost few (projected) arcsec. The stars within 0.7'' radius from the star group IRS13E do not co-move with this group, making it unlikely that IRS13E is the core of a substantial star cluster. Overall, the GC late-type cluster is described well as a uniform, isotropic, rotating, dynamically relaxed, phase-mixed system.

This review summarizes the recent progress in observational and theoretical work on the central parsec, with a strong emphasis on the current empirical evidence for a central massive black hole and on the processes in the surrounding dense nuclear star cluster. Current evidence is presented, from the analysis of the orbits of more than two dozen stars and from the measurements of the size and motion of the central compact radio source, Sgr A* , that this radio source must be a massive black hole of about 4.4×106M\&sun; , beyond any reasonable doubt. What is known about the structure and evolution of the dense nuclear star cluster surrounding this black hole is reported, including the astounding fact that stars have been forming in the vicinity of Sgr A* recently, apparently with a top-heavy stellar-mass function. A dense concentration of fainter stars centered in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole are discussed, three of which have orbital peri-bothroi of less than one light day. This ``S-star cluster''appears to consist mainly of young early-type stars, in contrast to the predicted properties of an equilibrium ``stellar cusp''around a black hole. This constitutes a remarkable and presently not fully understood ``paradox of youth.''What is known about the emission properties of the accreting gas onto Sgr A* is also summarized and how this emission is beginning to delineate the physical properties in the hot accretion zone around the event horizon.},

The emerging flux and the rotation rates of stars can vary widely, yet there are common elements that must contribute to building and maintaining the vibrantly evolving magnetic activity they exhibit. Some of these elements, such as the rotational shear and meridional flows established by the coupling of convection with rotation, can now be studied in detail within our nearest star using helioseismology. Major three-dimensional numerical simulations help refine our intuitions about such interior dynamics, aided by rapid advances in supercomputing that are improving the fidelity of the modeling. These developments, combined with intense thrusts at new high resolution and continuous observations of solar magnetism and solar oscillations, herald a promising era for exploring such astrophysical fluid dynamics.},

With the aid of energy considerations it is shown that a luminous QSO may be powered by accretion onto a black hole with a mass corresponding to that of 100 million solar masses. It is proposed that the blue continuum component of 3C 273 is thermal continuum emission from the inner part of an accretion disk that powers 3C 273. The present model suggests that many QSOs and Seyfert galaxies may show a power law continuum plus thermal emission from the disk at optical or UV frequencies. Many such objects show indeed a flattening or upturn of their continua in the blue. The QSO PHL 957 shows a flat continuum and indications of a cutoff at the highest observed frequencies.},

The model provides a good fit either of the raising part of the light curve in the bands gP1, rP1 and iP1 or in the early decay. The parameters characterizing this optimized model are the mass of the central black hole, i.e. 6.3 ×106 M\&sun;, and the critical Reynolds number R = 10\^{}4 that fixes the viscosity and the accretion time-scale. Such a high value of R explains the low disc temperature and the consequent absence of X-ray emission. The predicted bolometric peak luminosity is about 1045 erg s- 1 and the predicted total radiated energy is about Erad = 2.67 ×1051 erg.},

Each has a uniquely shaped light curve that is characterized by periodic brightening or variability at timescales of 4-20 days, frequently accompanied by shorter period oscillations. We can explain the dominant features of the entire class with orbitally varying tidal forces that occur in close, eccentric binary systems. The large variety of light curve shapes arises from viewing systems at different angles. This hypothesis is supported by spectroscopic radial velocity measurements for five systems, each showing evidence of being in an eccentric binary system. Prior to the discovery of these 17 new systems, only four stars, where KOI-54 is the best example, were known to have evidence of these dynamic tides and tidally induced oscillations. We perform preliminary fits to the light curves and radial velocity data, present the overall properties of this class, and discuss the work required to accurately model these systems.},

Using a smooth particle hydrodynamics code with a 13-isotope, α-chain nuclear network, we examine the resulting 56Ni yield as a function of total mass, mass ratio, and impact parameter. We show that several combinations of white dwarf masses and impact parameters are able to produce sufficient quantities of 56Ni to be observable at cosmological distances. We find that the 56Ni production in double-degenerate white dwarf collisions ranges from sub-luminous to the super-luminous, depending on the parameters of the collision. For all mass pairs, collisions with small impact parameters have the highest likelihood of detonating, but 56Ni production is insensitive to this parameter in high-mass combinations, which significantly increases their likelihood of detection. We also find that the 56Ni dependence on total mass and mass ratio is not linear, with larger-mass primaries producing disproportionately more 56Ni than their lower-mass secondary counterparts, and symmetric pairs of masses producing more 56Ni than asymmetric pairs.},

In this paper, we present the results of a set of simulations of the close encounters and collisions of two white dwarfs. We use an up-to-date smoothed particle hydrodynamics code that incorporates very detailed input physics and an improved treatment of the artificial viscosity. Our simulations have been done using a large number of particles (\~{}4 ×105) and covering a wide range of velocities and initial distances of the colliding white dwarfs. We discuss in detail when the initial eccentric binary white dwarf survives the closest approach, when a lateral collision in which several mass transfer episodes occur is the outcome of the newly formed binary system, and which range of input parameters leads to a direct collision, in which only one mass transfer episode occurs. We also discuss the characteristics of the final configuration and assess the possible observational signatures of the merger, such as the associated gravitational waveforms and the fallback luminosities. We find that the overall evolution of the system and the main characteristics of the final object agree with those found in previous studies. We also find that the fallback luminosities are close to 1048 ergs-1. Finally, we find that in the case of lateral and direct collisions the gravitational waveforms are characterized by large-amplitude peaks which are followed by a ring-down phase, while in the case in which the binary white dwarf survives the closest approach, the gravitational pattern shows a distinctive behaviour, typical of eccentric systems.},

The mean SED requires a bolometric correction (relative to 2500A) of BC=2.75+-0.40 using the integrated light from 1um-2keV, and we further explore the range of bolometric corrections exhibited by individual objects. In addition, we investigate the dependence of the mean SED on various parameters, particularly the UV luminosity for quasars with 0.5<z<3 and the properties of the UV emission lines for quasars with z>1.6; the latter is a possible indicator of the strength of the accretion disk wind, which is expected to be SED dependent. Luminosity-dependent mean SEDs show that, relative to the high-luminosity SED, low-luminosity SEDs exhibit a harder (bluer) far-UV spectral slope, a redder optical continuum, and less hot dust. Mean SEDs constructed instead as a function of UV emission line properties reveal changes that are consistent with known Principal Component Analysis (PCA) trends. A potentially important contribution to the bolometric correction is the unseen extream-UV (EUV) continuum. Our work suggests that lower-luminosity quasars and/or quasars with disk-dominated broad emission lines may require an extra continuum component in the EUV that is not present (or much weaker) in high-luminosity quasars with strong accretion disk winds. As such, we consider four possible models and explore the resulting bolometric corrections. Understanding these various SED-dependent effects will be important for accurate determination of quasar accretion rates.

In this Letter, we examine the effect of this H-rich layer on mass transfer in He+C/O double white dwarf binaries that will eventually merge and possibly yield a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in the double detonation scenario. Because its thermal profile and equation of state differ from the underlying He core, the H-rich layer is transferred stably onto the C/O white dwarf prior to the He core's tidal disruption. We find that this material is ejected from the binary system and sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium hundreds to thousands of years before the SN Ia. The close match between the resulting circumstellar medium profiles and values inferred from recent observations of circumstellar absorption in SNe Ia gives further credence to the resurgent double detonation scenario.},

	N2 = {Recently, several Type Ib supernovae (SNe; with the prototypical SN 2005E) have been shown to have atypical properties. These SNe are faint (absolute peak magnitude of \~{} - 15) and fast SNe that show unique composition. They are inferred to have low ejecta mass (a few tenths of a solar mass) and to be highly enriched in calcium, but poor in silicon elements and nickel. These SNe were therefore suggested to belong to a new class of calcium-rich faint SNe explosions. Their properties were proposed to be the result of helium detonations that may occur on helium accreting white dwarfs. In this paper, we theoretically study the scenario of helium detonations and focus on the results of detonations in accreted helium layers on low-mass carbon-oxygen (CO) cores. We present new results from one-dimensional simulations of such explosions, including their light curves and spectra. We find that when the density of the helium layer is low enough the helium detonation produces large amounts of intermediate elements, such as calcium and titanium, together with a large amount of unburnt helium. Alternatively, enough carbon enrichment of the accreted helium as a result of convective undershoot at the early stages of the runaway can avoid the production of iron group elements as the alpha particles are consumed avoiding iron production. Our results suggest that the properties of calcium-rich faint SNe could indeed be consistent with the helium-detonation scenario on small CO cores. Above a certain density (larger CO cores) the detonation leaves mainly 56Ni and unburnt helium, and the predicted spectrum will unlikely fit the unique features of this class of SNe. Finally, none of our studied models reproduces the bright, fast-evolving light curves of another type of peculiar SNe suggested to originate in helium detonations (SNe 1885A, 1939B, and 2002bj).},

The main goal of our analysis is to test whether or not the observed companion mass ratio distribution (CMRD) as a function of primary star mass and star formation environment is consistent with having been drawn from the field star initial mass function (IMF). We consider samples of companions for M dwarfs, solar-type stars, and intermediate-mass stars, both in the field as well as clusters or associations, and compare them with populations of binaries generated by random pairing from the assumed IMF for a fixed primary mass. With regard to the field we can reject the hypothesis that the CMRD was drawn from the IMF for different primary mass ranges: the observed CMRDs show a larger number of equal-mass systems than predicted by the IMF. This is in agreement with fragmentation theories of binary formation. For the open clusters αPersei and the Pleiades we also reject the IMF random-pairing hypothesis. Concerning young star-forming regions, currently we can rule out a connection between the CMRD and the field IMF in Taurus but not in Chamaeleon I. Larger and different samples are needed to better constrain the result as a function of the environment. We also consider other companion mass functions and we compare them with observations. Moreover the CMRD both in the field and clusters or associations appears to be independent of separation in the range covered by the observations. Combining therefore the CMRDs of M (1-2400 AU) and G (28-1590 AU) primaries in the field and intermediate-mass primary binaries in Sco OB2 (29-1612 AU) for mass ratios, q = M 2/M 1, from 0.2 to 1, we find that the best chi-square fit follows a power law dN/dqvpropq β, with β= -0.50 $\pm$0.29, consistent with previous results. Finally, we note that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gives a \~{}1{\%} probability of the observed CMRD in the Pleiades and Taurus being consistent with that observed for solar-type primaries in the field over comparable primary mass range. This highlights the value of using CMRDs to understand which star formation events contribute most to the field.},

For each star that is disrupted, others narrowly escape after being subjected to extreme tidal distortion, spin-up, mixing, and mass loss, which may affect their evolution and appearance. We show that it is likely that a significant fraction of the stars around massive BHs in galactic centers have undergone such extreme tidal interactions and survived subsequent total disruption, either by being deflected off their orbit or by missing the BH due to its Brownian motion. We discuss possible long-term observable consequences of this process, which may be relevant for understanding the nature of stars in galactic centers and may provide a signature of the existence of massive BHs there.},

	N2 = {The centers of most known galaxies host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In orbit around these black holes are a centrally concentrated distribution of stars, both in single and in binary systems. Occasionally, these stars are perturbed onto orbits that bring them close to the SMBH. If the star is in a binary system, the three-body interaction with the SMBH can lead to large changes in orbital energy, depositing one of the two stars on a tightly-bound orbit, and its companion into a hyperbolic orbit that may escape the galaxy. In this Letter, we show that the disruption of solitary stars can also lead to large positive increases in orbital energy. The kick velocity depends on the amount of mass the star loses at pericenter, but not on the ratio of black hole to stellar mass, and are at most the star's own escape velocity. We find that these kicks are usually too small to result in the ejection of stars from the Milky Way, but can eject the stars from the black hole's sphere of influence, reducing their probability of being disrupted again. We estimate that {\{}\mathord {\{}\sim {\}}{\}} 10\^{}5 stars, {\{}\mathord {\{}\sim {\}}{\}} 1{\%} of all stars within 10 pc of the galactic center, are likely to have had mass removed by the central black hole through tidal interaction, and speculate that these "turbovelocity" stars will at first be redder, but eventually bluer, and always brighter than their unharassed peers.},

We fit the Swift 2010 outburst decline light curve with an exponential decay, a knee and a linear decay. We find that the disc has an outer radius of 1012 ≲Rout ≲1013 cm, only an order of magnitude larger than typical accretion discs in the high/soft state of Galactic black holes. By contrast, the semimajor axis is ≈a few ×1014 cm. This discrepancy can be explained with a highly eccentric orbit. We estimate the tidal truncation radius and circularization radius around the black hole at periastron, and impose that they are similar or smaller than the outer disc radius. We obtain that e ≳0.95, that the radius of the donor star is ≲a few solar radii and that the donor star is not at risk of tidal disruption. If the companion star fills its Roche lobe and impulsively transfers mass only around periastron, secular evolution of the orbit is expected to increase eccentricity and semimajor axis even further. We speculate that such extremely eccentric systems may have the same origin as the S stars in the Galactic Centre.},

Assuming a delta function mass transfer rate centered at periastron, we find rates of secular change of the orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity which are linearly proportional to the magnitude of the mass transfer rate at periastron. The rates can be positive as well as negative, so that the semimajor axis and eccentricity can increase as well as decrease in time. Adopting a delta function mass-transfer rate of 10-9 Msolar yr-1 at periastron yields orbital evolution timescales ranging from a few Myr to a Hubble time or more, depending on the binary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity. Comparison with orbital evolution timescales due to dissipative tides furthermore shows that tides cannot, in all cases, circularize the orbit rapidly enough to justify the often-adopted assumption of instantaneous circularization at the onset of mass transfer. The formalism presented can be incorporated in binary evolution and population synthesis codes to create a self-consistent treatment of mass transfer in eccentric binaries.},

We adopt a binary potential that accounts for nonsynchronous rotation and eccentric orbits and calculate the positions of the Lagrangian points as functions of the mass ratio, the degree of asynchronism, the orbital eccentricity, and the position of the stars or planets in their relative orbit. We find that the geometry of the equipotential surfaces may facilitate nonconservative mass transfer in nonsynchronous, eccentric binary star and planetary systems, especially if the component stars or planets are rotating supersynchronously at the periastron of their relative orbit. We also calculate the volume-equivalent radius of the Roche lobe as a function of the four parameters mentioned above. Contrary to common practice, we find that replacing the radius of a circular orbit in the fitting formula of Eggleton with the instantaneous distance between the components of eccentric binary or planetary systems does not always lead to a good approximation to the volume-equivalent radius of the Roche lobe. We therefore provide generalized analytic fitting formulae for the volume-equivalent Roche lobe radius appropriate for nonsynchronous, eccentric binary star and planetary systems. These formulae are accurate to better than 1{\%} throughout the relevant two-dimensional parameter space that covers a dynamic range of 16 and 6 orders of magnitude in the two dimensions.},

Adopting a delta function mass transfer rate at the periastron of the binary orbit, we find that, depending on the initial binary properties at the onset of mass transfer, the orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity can either increase or decrease at a rate linearly proportional to the magnitude of the mass transfer rate at periastron. The range of initial binary mass ratios and eccentricities that lead to increasing orbital semimajor axes and eccentricities broadens with increasing degrees of mass loss from the system and narrows with increasing orbital angular momentum loss from the binary. Comparison with tidal evolution timescales shows that the usual assumption of rapid circularization at the onset of mass transfer in eccentric binaries is not justified, irrespective of the degree of systemic mass and angular momentum loss. This work extends our previous results for conservative mass transfer in eccentric binaries and can be incorporated into binary evolution and population synthesis codes to model non-conservative mass transfer in eccentric binaries.},

Finding the origin of this variability would constrain the still largely unknown properties of this extraordinary object. Since it exhibits a hardness-intensity behavior characteristic of black-hole X-ray transients, we have analyzed the variability of HLX-1 in the framework of the disk instability model that explains outbursts of such systems. We find that the long-term variability of HLX-1 is unlikely to be explained by a model in which outbursts are triggered by thermal-viscous instabilities in an accretion disk. Possible alternatives include the instability in a radiation-pressure-dominated disk but we argue that a more likely explanation is a modulated mass transfer due to tidal stripping of a star in an eccentric orbit around the IMBH. We consider an evolutionary scenario leading to the creation of such a system and estimate the probability of its observation. We conclude, using a simplified dynamical model of the post-collapse cluster, that no more than 1/100 to 1/10 of M *<\~{} 104 M sun IMBHs---formed by runaway stellar mergers in the dense collapsed cores of young clusters---could have a few ×1 M sun main-sequence star evolve to an asymptotic giant branch on an orbit eccentric enough for mass transfer at periapse, while avoiding collisional destruction or being scattered into the IMBH by two-body encounters. The finite but low probability of this configuration is consistent with the uniqueness of HLX-1. We note, however, that the actual response of a standard accretion disk to bursts of mass transfer may be too slow to explain the observations unless the orbit is close to parabolic (and hence even rarer). Also, increased heating, presumably linked to the highly time-dependent gravitational potential, could shorten the relevant timescales.},

Indirect arguments suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A statistical survey finds BHs in {\$}\sim 20\{\%}{\$} of nearby E--Sbc galaxies, consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component. Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation. Flashes caused by the accretion of individual stars may provide a test of the BH picture.},

This is an upward revision by a factor of 3.0-4.6 from a decade-old estimate by Soltan (1982). A typical bright galaxy is thus expected to contain a central black hole of greater than about 10 exp 7/cu h solar masses. Furthermore, we expect that greater than about 50 percent of rhoBH is contributed by objects of mass greater than about 10 exp 8/sq h solar masses and greater than about 10 percent by those more massive than about 6 x 10 exp 8/sq h solar masses.},

	N2 = {A generalized Newtonian potential is derived from the geodesic motion of test particles in Schwarzschild space-time. This potential reproduces several relativistic features with higher accuracy than commonly used pseudo-Newtonian approaches. The new potential reproduces the exact location of the marginally stable, marginally bound and photon circular orbits, as well as the exact radial dependence of the binding energy and the angular momentum of these orbits. Moreover, it reproduces the orbital and epicyclic angular frequencies to better than 6 per cent. In addition, the spatial projections of general trajectories coincide with their relativistic counterparts, while the time evolution of parabolic-like trajectories and the pericentre advance of elliptical-like trajectories are both reproduced exactly. We apply this approach to a standard thin accretion disc and find that the efficiency of energy extraction agrees to within 3 per cent with the exact relativistic value, while the energy flux per unit area as a function of radius is reproduced everywhere to better than 7 per cent. As a further astrophysical application we implement the new approach within a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code and study the tidal disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. The results obtained are in very good agreement with previous relativistic simulations of tidal disruptions in Schwarzschild space-time. The equations of motion derived from this potential can be implemented easily within existing Newtonian hydrodynamics codes with hardly any additional computational effort.},

We have fitted models with inclinations from 29 deg (intrinsic galaxy type E5) to 90 deg (intrinsic E1) and black hole masses from 0 to 109 Msolar. The best-fit black hole masses range from 6x107 to 2x108 Msolar, depending on inclination. The preferred inclination is 90 deg (edge-on) however, the constraints on allowed inclination are not very strong, owing to our assumption of constant M/LV. The velocity ellipsoid of the best model is not consistent with either isotropy or a two-integral distribution function. Along the major axis, the velocity ellipsoid becomes tangential at the innermost bin, radial in the midrange radii, and tangential again at the outermost bins. The rotation rises quickly at small radii owing to the presence of the black hole. For the acceptable models, the radial-to-tangential {$[$}(σ2θ+σ2φ)/2{$]$} dispersion in the midrange radii ranges over 1.1<σr/σt<1.7, with the smaller black holes requiring larger radial anisotropy. Compared with these three-integral models, two-integral isotropic models overestimate the black hole mass since they cannot provide adequate radial motion. However, the models presented in this paper still contain restrictive assumptions-namely, assumptions of constant M/LV and spheroidal symmetry-requiring yet more models to study black hole properties in complete generality.},

	N2 = {When a star comes within a critical distance to a supermassive black hole (SMBH), immense tidal forces disrupt the star, resulting in a stream of debris that falls back onto the SMBH and powers a luminous flare. In this paper, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption of a main-sequence star by an SMBH to characterize the evolution of the debris stream after a tidal disruption. We demonstrate that this debris stream is confined by self-gravity in the two directions perpendicular to the original direction of the star's travel and as a consequence has a negligible surface area and makes almost no contribution to either the continuum or line emission. We therefore propose that any observed emission lines are not the result of photoionization in this unbound debris, but are produced in the region above and below the forming elliptical accretion disk, analogous to the broad-line region (BLR) in steadily accreting active galactic nuclei. As each line within a BLR is observationally linked to a particular location in the accretion disk, we suggest that the absence of a line indicates that the accretion disk does not yet extend to the distance required to produce that line. This model can be used to understand the spectral properties of the tidal disruption event PS1-10jh, for which He II lines are observed, but the Balmer series and He I are not. Using a maximum likelihood analysis, we show that the disruption of a main-sequence star of near-solar composition can reproduce this event.},

We include the effects of ionizing and non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation and X-rays from population synthesis models of young star clusters. For all our simulations we find that the H II region expansion reduces the disordered component of the magnetic field, imposing a large-scale order on the field around its border, with the field in the neutral gas tending to lie along the ionization front, while the field in the ionized gas tends to be perpendicular to the front. The highest pressure-compressed neutral and molecular gas is driven towards approximate equipartition between thermal, magnetic and turbulent energy densities, whereas lower pressure neutral/molecular gas bifurcates into, on the one hand, quiescent, magnetically dominated regions and, on the other hand, turbulent, demagnetized regions. The ionized gas shows approximate equipartition between thermal and turbulent energy densities, but with magnetic energy densities that are 1-3 orders of magnitude lower. A high velocity dispersion (˜8 km s-1) is maintained in the ionized gas throughout our simulations, despite the mean expansion velocity being significantly lower. The magnetic field does not significantly brake the large-scale H II region expansion on the length and time-scales accessible to our simulations, but it does tend to suppress the smallest scale fragmentation and radiation-driven implosion of neutral/molecular gas that forms globules and pillars at the edge of the H II region. However, the relative luminosity of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation has a much larger influence than the presence or absence of the magnetic field. When the star cluster radiation field is relatively soft (as in the case of a lower mass cluster, containing an earliest spectral type of B0.5), then fragmentation is less vigorous and a thick, relatively smooth PDR forms.},

We use realistic stellar structure models to calculate analytically the tidal spin-up in soft encounters and extend these results to close and penetrating collisions using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We find that the spin-up effect falls off only slowly with distance from the black hole because the increased tidal coupling in slower collisions at larger distances compensates for the decrease in the stellar density. We apply our results to the stars near the massive black hole in the Galactic center. Over their lifetime, \~{}1 Msolar main-sequence stars in the inner 0.3 pc of the Galactic center are spun-up on average to \~{}10{\%}-30{\%} of the centrifugal breakup limit.

	N2 = {This review covers the main aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. We begin with the view that one of the main goals of the theory is to better understand the nature of black holes themselves. In this light we discuss how accretion disks might reveal some of the unique signatures of strong gravity: the event horizon, the innermost stable circular orbit, and the ergosphere. We then review, from a first-principles perspective, the physical processes at play in accretion disks. This leads us to the four primary accretion disk models that we review: Polish doughnuts (thick disks), Shakura-Sunyaev (thin) disks, slim disks, and advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). After presenting the models we discuss issues of stability, oscillations, and jets. Following our review of the analytic work, we take a parallel approach in reviewing numerical studies of black hole accretion disks. We finish with a few select applications that highlight particular astrophysical applications: measurements of black hole mass and spin, black hole vs. neutron star accretion disks, black hole accretion disk spectral states, and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).},

	N2 = {The Galactic massive black hole (MBH), with a mass of M*= 3.6 ×106Msolar, is the closest known MBH, at a distance of only 8kpc. The proximity of this MBH makes it possible to observe gravitational waves (GWs) from stars with periapse in the observational frequency window of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). This is possible even if the orbit of the star is very eccentric, so that the orbital frequency is many orders of magnitude below the LISA frequency window, as suggested by Rubbo, Holley-Bockelmann \& Finn (2006). Here we give an analytical estimate of the detection rate of such GW bursts. The burst rate is critically sensitive to the inner cut-off of the stellar density profile. Our model accounts for mass segregation and for the physics determining the inner radius of the cusp, such as stellar collisions, energy dissipation by GW emission and consequences of the finite number of stars. We find that stellar BHs have a burst rate of the order of 1yr-1, while the rate is of the order of <\~{}0.1yr-1 for main-sequence stars and white dwarfs. These analytical estimates are supported by a series of Monte Carlo samplings of the expected distribution of stars around the Galactic MBH, which yield the full probability distribution for the rates. We estimate that no burst will be observable from the Virgo cluster.},

	N2 = {Numerical simulations of hot accretion flow, both hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical, have shown that the mass accretion rate decreases with decreasing radius; consequently, the density profile of accretion flow becomes flatter than in the case of a constant accretion rate. This result has important theoretical and observational implications. However, because of technical difficulties, the radial dynamic range in almost all previous simulations usually spans at most two orders of magnitude. This small dynamical range, combined with the effects of boundary conditions, makes the simulation results suspect. In particular, the radial profiles of density and inflow rate may not be precise enough to be used to compare with observations. In this paper, we present a "two-zone" approach to expand the radial dynamical range from two to four orders of magnitude. We confirm previous results and find that from rs to 104 rs the radial profiles of accretion rate and density can be well described by \dot{\{}M{\}}(r)\propto r\^{}s and ρvpropr -p . The values of (s, p) are (0.48, 0.65) and (0.4, 0.85) for the viscous parameters α= 0.001 and α= 0.01, respectively. More precisely, the accretion rate is constant (i.e., s = 0) within \~{}10rs , but beyond 10rs we have s = 0.65 and 0.54 for α= 0.001 and 0.01, respectively. We find that the values of both s and p are similar in all numerical simulation works irrespective of whether a magnetic field is included or not and what kind of initial conditions are adopted. Such an apparently surprising "common" result can be explained by the most recent version of the adiabatic inflow-outflow model. The density profile we obtain is in good quantitative agreement with that obtained from the detailed observations and modeling of Sgr A* and NGC 3115. The origin and implications of such a profile will be investigated in a subsequent paper.},

	N2 = {Hydrodynamical (HD) and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations of hot accretion flows have indicated that the inflow accretion rate decreases inward. Two models have been proposed to explain this result. In the adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS), this is because of the loss of gas in the outflow. In the alternative convection-dominated accretion flow model, it is thought that the flow is convectively unstable and gas is locked in convective eddies. We investigate the nature of the inward decrease of the accretion rate using HD and MHD simulations. We calculate various properties of the inflow and outflow such as temperature and rotational velocity. Systematic and significant differences are found. These results suggest that the inflow and outflow are not simply convective turbulence; instead, systematic inward and outward motion (i.e., real outflow) must exist. We have also analyzed the convective stability of MHD accretion flows and found that they are stable. These results favor the ADIOS scenario. We suggest that the mechanisms of producing outflow in HD and MHD flows are the buoyancy associated with the convection and the centrifugal force associated with the angular momentum transport mediated by the magnetic field, respectively. The latter is similar to the Blandford \& Payne mechanism but no large-scale open magnetic field is required. We discuss some possible observational applications, including the Fermi bubble in the Galactic center and winds in active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries.},

	N2 = {Accretion onto a supermassive black hole of a rotating inflow is a particularly difficult problem to study because of the wide range of length scales involved. There have been broadly utilized analytic and numerical treatments of the global properties of accretion flows, but detailed numerical simulations are required to address certain critical aspects. We use the ZEUS code to run hydrodynamical simulations of rotating, axisymmetric accretion flows with Bremsstrahlung cooling, considering solutions for which the centrifugal balance radius significantly exceeds the Schwarzschild radius, with and without viscous angular momentum transport. Infalling gas is followed from well beyond the Bondi radius down to the vicinity of the black hole. We produce a continuum of solutions with respect to the single parameter \dot{\{}M{\}}{\_}B/\dot{\{}M{\}}{\_}Edd, and there is a sharp transition between two general classes of solutions at an Eddington ratio of \dot{\{}M{\}}{\_}B/\dot{\{}M{\}}{\_}Edd\sim few\times 10\^{}{\{}-2{\}}. Our high inflow solutions are very similar to the standard Shakura \& Sunyaev results. But our low inflow results are to zeroth order the stationary Papaloizou \& Pringle solution, which has no accretion. To next order in the small, assumed viscosity they show circulation, with disk and conical wind outflows almost balancing inflow. These solutions are characterized by hot, vertically extended disks, and net accretion proceeds at an extremely low rate, only of order αtimes the inflow rate. Our simulations have converged with respect to spatial resolution and temporal duration, and they do not depend strongly on our choice of boundary conditions.},

	N2 = {Several tens of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) have been discovered escaping our Galaxy. These stars share a common origin in the Galactic center and are distributed anisotropically in Galactic longitude and latitude. We examine the possibility that HVSs may be created as the result of supernovae (SNe) occurring within binary systems in a disk of stars around Sgr A* over the last 100 Myr. Monte Carlo simulations show that the rate of binary disruption is \~{}10-4 yr-1, comparable to that of tidal disruption models. The SN-induced HVS production rate (ΓHVS) is significantly increased if the binaries are hardened via migration through a gaseous disk. Moderate hardening gives ΓHVS \~{}= 2 ×10-7 yr-1 and an estimated population of \~{}20 HVSs in the last 100 Myr. SN-induced HVS production requires the internal and external orbital velocity vectors of the secondary binary component to be aligned when the binary is disrupted. This leaves an imprint of the disk geometry on the spatial distribution of the HVSs, producing a distinct anisotropy.},

	N2 = {When a spinning system experiences a transient gravitational encounter with an external perturber, a quasi-resonance occurs if the spin frequency of the victim roughly matches the peak angular speed of the perturber. Such encounters are responsible for the formation of long tails and bridges during galaxy collisions. For high-speed encounters, the resulting velocity perturbations can be described by the impulse approximation. The traditional impulse approximation, however, does not distinguish between prograde and retrograde encounters, and therefore completely misses the resonant response. Here, we modify the impulse approximation to include the effects of quasi-resonant phenomena on stars orbiting within a disk. Explicit expressions are derived for the velocity and energy changes to the stars induced by tidal forces from an external gravitational perturber passing either on a straight line or a parabolic orbit. Comparisons with numerical-restricted three-body calculations illustrate the applicability of our analysis.},

Using a sample of 1630 optical spectra of 255 SNe, based primarily on data from the CfA Supernova Program, we examine how the velocity evolution and line strengths of Si II λ6355 and Ca II H\&K are related to the B - V color at peak brightness. We find that the maximum-light velocity of Si II λ6355 and Ca II H\&K and the maximum-light pseudo-equivalent width of Si II λ6355 are correlated with intrinsic color, with intrinsic color having a linear relation with the Si II λ6355 measurements. Ca II H\&K does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color, but lower-velocity SNe tend to be intrinsically bluer. Combining the spectroscopic measurements does not improve intrinsic color inference. The intrinsic color scatter is larger for higher-velocity SNe Ia---even after removing a linear trend with velocity---indicating that lower-velocity SNe Ia are more "standard crayons." Employing information derived from SN Ia spectra has the potential to improve the measurements of extragalactic distances and the cosmological properties inferred from them.},

	N2 = {We use a sample of 121 spectroscopically normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to show that their intrinsic color is correlated with their ejecta velocity, as measured from the blueshift of the Si II λ6355 feature near maximum brightness, v Si II . The SN Ia sample was originally used by Wang et al. to show that the relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absence of intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for two subsamples split by v Si II (defined as "Normal" and "High Velocity"). We verify this result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law when extremely reddened events (E(B - V)>0.35 mag) are excluded. We also show that (1) the High-Velocity subsample is offset by \~{}0.06 mag to the red from the Normal subsample in the (B max - V max)-MV plane, (2) the B max - V max cumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identical shapes, but the High-Velocity subsample is offset by \~{}0.07 mag to the red in B max - V max, and (3) the bluest High-Velocity SNe Ia are \~{}0.10 mag redder than the bluest Normal SNe Ia. Together, this evidence indicates a difference in intrinsic color for the subsamples. Accounting for this intrinsic color difference reduces the scatter in Hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 mag for SNe Ia with AV <\~{} 0.7 mag. The scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 mag by exclusively using SNe Ia from the Normal subsample. Additionally, this result can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of RV found in large SN Ia samples. We explain the correlation between ejecta velocity and color as increased line blanketing in the High-Velocity SNe Ia, causing them to become redder. We discuss some implications of this result, and stress the importance of spectroscopy for future SN Ia cosmology surveys, with particular focus on the design of WFIRST.},

We will then present some recent observations of Mira suggesting that even very wide symbiotic experience a new form of Roche-lobe overflow, ``wind Roche-lobe overflow''. We will present preliminary hydrodynamical simulations of this type of mass transfer and discuss its implications for the shaping of (proto-)planetary nebulae, the origin of barium stars and potentially Type Ia supernova progenitors.},

Angular momentum is transported by a variety of classic instabilities and also by magnetic torques from fields generated by the differential rotation. We present the first stellar evolution calculations to follow the evolution of rotating massive stars including, at least approximately, all these effects, magnetic and nonmagnetic, from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of iron-core collapse. The evolution and action of the magnetic fields is as described by Spruit in 2002, and a range of uncertain parameters is explored. In general, we find that magnetic torques decrease the final rotation rate of the collapsing iron core by about a factor of 30-50 when compared with the nonmagnetic counterparts. Angular momentum in that part of the presupernova star destined to become a neutron star is an increasing function of main-sequence mass. That is, pulsars derived from more massive stars rotate faster and rotation plays a more important role in the star's explosion. The final angular momentum of the core has been determined-to within a factor of 2-by the time the star ignites carbon burning. For the lighter stars studied, around 15 Msolar, we predict pulsar periods at birth near 15 ms, though a factor of 2 range is easily tolerated by the uncertainties. Several mechanisms for additional braking in a young neutron star, especially by fallback, are explored.},

We present a sample light curve that was obtained using a time-dependent solution of the radiative transport equation with a spectral resolution of 80 km s-1 and employing an LTE equation of state. The result compares favorably with light curves and spectra of typical supernovae and is used to illustrate the physics controlling the evolution of the light curve and especially the secondary maxima seen in infrared photometry.},

This model is used to derive the thermal conditions in the interior of SNe Ia and to study the sensitivity of light curves to various properties of the underlying supernova explosions. Although the model is limited by simplifying assumptions, it is adequate for demonstrating that the relationship between SNe Ia maximum-light luminosity and rate of decline is most easily explained if SNe Ia span a range in mass. The analytic model is also used to examine the size of various terms in the transport equation under conditions appropriate to maximum light. For instance, the Eulerian and advective time derivatives are each shown to be of the same order of magnitude as other order v/c terms in the transport equation. We conclude that a fully time-dependent solution to the transport problem is needed in order to compute SNe Ia light curves and spectra accurate enough to distinguish subtle differences of various explosion models.},

The calculations are carried out using a multi-frequency radiation transport code that includes opacity from all important mechanisms-bound-bound, bound-free, free-free, and electron scattering. It is found that the inclusion of opacity sources besides electron scattering increases the computed lenght of the plateau in the 15 solar mass model by approximately 30 days. Especially important is the ultraviolet cutoff caused by a thick forest of lines. Deposition and escape of gamma-rays from radioactive decay are also accurately simulated. We find that the presence of 0.06 solar mass of ejected Ni-56 extends the length of the plateau from approximately 100 days to approximately 140 dys. Because of the large hydrogen envleope and radius in this model, mixing does not appreciably alter the bolometric light curve, although it does change the gamma-ray light curve significantly. With 0.06 solar mass of ejected Ni-56, the unmixed (mixed) model peaks in escaping gamma-rays at 576 (466) days with gamma-ray luminosity of 3 x 1038 ergs/s. Except for the local group, the gamma-rays from an extragalactic 15 solar mass SNe IIp will be too faint to detect with any existing detectors. However, a Galactic SNe IIp would be quite bright and easily detectable.},

The main physical assumptions are discussed, especially where they differ from the previous application to stellar winds. These include the calculation of the density and temperature stratification in the envelope, a more realistic treatment of ionization, and the treatment of radiative transfer on the assumption of a purely scattering atmosphere (Schuster-Schwarzschild model). A detailed outline of the code, which has already been applied successfully to both supernovae (SNe) II and Ia, is also given, and the main advantages of using Monte Carlo methods for the synthesis of supernova (SN) spectra are emphasized. These lie in the simplicity of the treatment of the multiline transfer, which is useful since line overlapping due to the large velocities reached by the expanding matter is common in a SN envelope; the implicit incorporation of line-blocking of the radiation field, which allows photoionization rates to be calculated straightforwardly; and the possibility of including relativistic effects easily. The isotropy of the expansion in SN envelopes also allows for simplicity and efficiency of the optical depth integrations. The degree of self-consistency of our code is such that only basic parameters are required as input, so that the synthetic spectra yield valuable information on essential SN parameters such as the bolometric luminosity, the photospheric velocity and the effective wavelength of line formation.},

The radiative transfer is time-dependent and includes all effects of O(v/c). Monte Carlo quantization is achieved by discretizing the initial distribution of 56Ni into N radioactive pellets. Each pellet decays with the emission of a single energy packet comprising γ-ray photons representing one line from either the 56Ni or the 56Co decay spectrum. Subsequently, these energy packets propagate through the homologously-expanding ejecta with appropriate changes in the nature of their contained energy as they undergo Compton scatterings and pure absorptions. The 3-D code is tested by applying it to a spherically-symmetric SN in which the transfer of optical radiation is treated with a grey absorption coefficient. This 1-D problem is separately solved using Castor's co-moving frame moment equations. Satisfactory agreement is obtained. The Monte Carlo code is a platform onto which more advanced treatments of the interactions of matter and radiation can be added. Some of these have already been developed and tested in previous papers and are summarized here.},

We describe two-dimensional simulations of the evolution of a detonation as it breaks through the accreted envelope of the neutron star and propagates laterally through the accreted material. The detonation front propagates laterally at nearly the Chapman-Jouguet velocity, v=1.3×109 cm s-1. A series of surface waves propagate across the pool of hot ash behind the detonation front with the same speed, matching the speed expected from shallow water wave theory. The entire envelope oscillates in the gravitational potential well of the neutron star with a period of \~{}50 μs. The photosphere reaches an estimated height of 10 km above the surface of the neutron star. Our study confirms that such a detonation can insure the spread of burning over the entire neutron star surface on a timescale consistent with burst rise times. We analyze the sensitivity of the results to the spatial resolution and the assumed initial conditions. We conclude by presenting a comparison of this model to type I X-ray bursts.},

	N2 = {We discuss differences in simulation results that arise between the use of either the thermal energy or the entropy as an independent variable in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In this context, we derive a new version of SPH that, when appropriate, manifestly conserves both energy and entropy if smoothing lengths are allowed to adapt freely to the local mass resolution. To test various formulations of SPH, we consider point-like energy injection, as in certain models of supernova feedback, and find that powerful explosions are well represented by SPH even when the energy is deposited into a single particle, provided that the entropy equation is integrated. If the thermal energy is instead used as an independent variable, unphysical solutions can be obtained for this problem. We also examine the radiative cooling of gas spheres that collapse and virialize in isolation, and of haloes that form in cosmological simulations of structure formation. When applied to these problems, the thermal energy version of SPH leads to substantial overcooling in haloes that are resolved with up to a few thousand particles, while the entropy formulation is biased only moderately low for these haloes under the same circumstances. For objects resolved with much larger particle numbers, the two approaches yield consistent results. We trace the origin of the differences to systematic resolution effects in the outer parts of cooling flows. When the thermal energy equation is integrated and the resolution is low, the compressional heating of the gas in the inflow region is underestimated, violating entropy conservation and improperly accelerating cooling. The cumulative effect of this overcooling can be significant. In cosmological simulations of moderate size, we find that the fraction of baryons which cool and condense can be reduced by up to a factor \~{}2 if the entropy equation is employed rather than the thermal energy equation, partly explaining discrepancies with semi-analytic treatments of galaxy formation. We also demonstrate that the entropy method leads to a greatly reduced scatter in the density-temperature relation of the low-density Lyαforest relative to the thermal energy approach, in accord with theoretical expectations.},

Here we apply the results of numerical simulations of giant impacts to constrain the lower bound in the mass-radius diagram that could arise from collisional mantle stripping of differentiated rocky/iron planets.

The increased data span allows significant measurements of the orbital eccentricity, e= (6.2 $\pm$1.3) ×10-5, and composite proper motion, μt= 7.3 $\pm$0.4 mas yr-1. Our timing observations have revealed secular variations of the projected semimajor axis of the pulsar orbit which are much more extreme than those previously published and of the orbital period of the system. Investigations of the physical mechanisms producing such variations confirm that the variations of the semimajor axis are most probably caused by classical spin-orbit coupling in the binary system, while the variations in orbital period are most likely caused by tidal dissipation leading to changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion.},

We show that the missing objects are low-mass giants and asymptotic giant branch stars in the range 1-3Msolar. Using detailed stellar evolution calculations, we find that to prevent these objects from evolving to become visible in the depleted K bands, we require that they suffer collisions on the red giant branch, and we calculate the fractional envelope mass losses required. Using a combination of smoothed particle hydrodynamic calculations, restricted three-body analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the expected collision rates between giants and black holes, and between giants and main-sequence stars in the Galactic Centre. We show that collisions can plausibly explain the missing giants in the 10.5 < K < 12 band. However, depleting the brighter (K < 10.5) objects out to the required radius would require a large population of black hole impactors which would in turn deplete the 10.5 < K < 12 giants in a region much larger than is observed. We conclude that collisions with stellar-mass black holes cannot account for the depletion of the very brightest giants, and we use our results to place limits on the population of stellar-mass black holes in the Galactic Centre.},

In this paper we extend this work by studying the evolution of the collision products in open clusters as a function of mass and age of the progenitor stars. We calculated a grid of head-on collisions covering the section of parameter space relevant for collisions in open clusters. We create detailed models of the merger remnants using an entropy-sorting algorithm and follow their subsequent evolution during the initial contraction phase, through the main sequence and up to the giant branch with our detailed stellar evolution code. We compare the location of our models in a colour-magnitude diagram to the observed blue straggler population of the old open clusters M 67 and NGC 188 and find that they cover the observed blue straggler region of both clusters. For M 67, collisions need to have taken place recently. Differences between the evolution tracks of the collision products and normal main sequence stars can be understood quantitatively using a simple analytic model. We present an analytic recipe that can be used in an N-body code to transform a precomputed evolution track for a normal star into an evolution track for a collision product.

	N2 = {Stellar collisions are an important formation channel for blue straggler stars in globular and old open clusters. Hydrodynamical simulations have shown that the remnants of such collisions are out of thermal equilibrium, are not strongly mixed and can rotate very rapidly. Detailed evolution models of collision products are needed to interpret observed blue straggler populations and to use them to probe the dynamical history of a star cluster. We expand on previous studies by presenting an efficient procedure to import the results of detailed collision simulations into a fully implicit stellar evolution code. Our code is able to evolve stellar collision products in a fairly robust manner and allows for a systematic study of their evolution. Using our code we have constructed detailed models of the collisional blue stragglers produced in the N-body simulation of M 67 performed by Hurley et al. in 2005. We assume the collisions are head-on and thus ignore the effects of rotation in this paper. Our detailed models are more luminous than normal stars of the same mass and in the same stage of evolution, but cooler than homogeneously mixed versions of the collision products. The increased luminosity and inefficient mixing decrease the remaining main-sequence lifetimes of the collision products, which are much shorter than predicted by the simple prescription commonly used in N-body simulations.},

We performed axisymmetric, nonrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the propagation of a nonrotating star with a dipole magnetic field aligned with its velocity through the ISM. Effects of rotation will be discussed in a subsequent work. We consider two cases: (1) where the accretion radius Racc is comparable to the magnetic standoff distance or Alfv{\'e}n radius RA and gravitational focusing is important and (2) where Racc<<RA and the magnetized star interacts with the ISM as a ``magnetic plow,'' without significant gravitational focusing. For the first case, simulations were done at a low Mach number M=3 for a range of values of the magnetic field B*. For the second case, simulations were done for higher Mach numbers, M=10, 30, and 50. In both cases, the magnetosphere of the star represents an obstacle for the flow, and a shock wave stands in front of the star. Magnetic field lines are stretched downwind from the star and form a hollow elongated magnetotail. Reconnection of the magnetic field is observed in the tail, which may lead to the acceleration of particles. Similar powers are estimated to be released in the bow shock wave and in the magnetotail. The estimated powers are, however, below present detection limits. Results of our simulations may be applied to other strongly magnetized stars, for example, white dwarfs and magnetic Ap stars. Future more sensitive observations may reveal bow shocks and long magnetotails of magnetized stars moving through the ISM.},

The last decade has seen a dramatic increase both in the recognition of key physical processes and in our ability to carry through direct numerical simulations of turbulent flow. Magnetic fields have at once powerful and subtle influences on the behavior of (sufficiently) ionized gas, rendering them directly unstable to free energy gradients. Outwardly descreasing angular velocity profiles are unstable. The breakdown of Keplerian rotation into MHD turbulence may be studied in some numerical detail, and key transport coefficients may be evaluated. Chandra observations of the Galactic Center support the existence of low luminosity accretion, which may ultimately prove amenable to global three-dimensional numerical simulation.},

	N2 = {We evaluate the prompt electromagnetic signatures of the merger between a massive close-in planet (a 'hot Jupiter') and its host star, events with an estimated Galactic rate of ˜0.1-1 yr-1. Depending on the ratio of the mean density of the planet ρ¯p to that of the star ρ¯⊙, a planet-star merger results in three possible outcomes. If ρ¯p/ρ¯⊙≳5, then the planet directly plunges below the stellar atmosphere before being disrupted by tidal forces. The dissipation of orbital energy creates a hot wake behind the planet, producing a extreme ultraviolet (EUV)/soft X-ray transient that increases in brightness and temperature as the planet sinks below the stellar surface. The peak luminosity LEUV/X ≲1036 erg s-1 is achieved weeks to months prior to merger, after which the stellar surface is enshrouded by an outflow driven by the merger. The final stages of the inspiral are accompanied by an optical transient powered by the recombination of hydrogen in the outflow, which peaks at a luminosity of ˜1037-1038 erg s-1 on a time-scale ˜days. If the star is instead significantly denser (ρ¯p/ρ¯⊙≲5), then the planet overflows its Roche lobe above the stellar surface. For ρ¯p/ρ¯⊙≲1 mass transfer is stable, resulting in the planet being accreted on the relatively slow time-scale set by tidal dissipation. However, for an intermediate-density range 1≲ρ¯p/ρ¯⊙≲5 mass transfer may instead be unstable, resulting in the dynamical disruption of the planet into an accretion disc around the star. Outflows from the super-Eddington accretion disc power an optical transient with a peak luminosity of ˜1037-1038 erg s-1 and characteristic duration ˜week-months. Emission from the disc itself becomes visible once the accretion rate decreases below the Eddington rate, resulting in a bolometric brightening and shift of the spectral peak to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Optical transients from both direct-impact merger and tidal-disruption events in some ways resemble classical novae, but can be distinguished by their higher ejecta mass and lower velocity around hundreds of km s-1, and by hard pre- and post-cursor emission, respectively. The most promising search strategy is with combined surveys of nearby massive galaxies (e.g. M31) at optical, UV and X-ray wavelengths with cadences from days to months.},

	N2 = {Motivated by the comments of Goodman (2009) on our paper concerning thermal tides (Arras and Socrates 2009a), we have studied an idealized problem to understand the global response of a completely fluid gas giant planet to thermal forcing at the surface (Arras and Socrates 2009b). Our findings disagree with the main claims in Goodman (2009). We find that significant quadrupole moments can indeed be induced as a result of thermal forcing. Furthermore, we find that it is possible for the orientation of the quadrupoles to be such that the planet is torqued away from synchronous rotation. Given these results, we believe our proposed thermal tide mechanism (Arras and Socrates 2009a) provides a viable scenario for generating steady-state asychronous rotation, inflated radii and possibly eccentric orbits of the hot Jupiters.},

It is shown here that because of the absence of a solid surface above the convective core of a jovian planet, the coupling of the gravitational and thermal tides vanishes to zeroth order in the ratio of the atmospheric scale height to the planetary radius. At the next order, the effect probably has the sign opposite to that claimed by the latter authors, hence reinforcing synchronous and circular orbits.},

	N2 = {I constrain a possible supernova origin for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by modelling the dynamical interaction between a relativistic jet and a stellar envelope surrounding it. The delay in observer time introduced by the jet traversing the envelope should not be long compared with the duration of gamma-ray emission; also, the jet should not be swallowed by the spherical explosion it powers. The only stellar progenitors that comfortably satisfy these constraints, if one assumes that jets move ballistically within their host stars, are compact carbon-oxygen or helium post-Wolf-Rayet stars (type Ic or Ib supernovae); type II supernovae are ruled out. Notably, very massive stars do not appear to be capable of producing the observed bursts at any redshift unless the stellar envelope is stripped prior to collapse. The presence of a dense stellar wind places an upper limit on the Lorentz factor of the jet in the internal shock model; however, this constraint may be evaded if the wind is swept forward by a photon precursor. Shock breakout and cocoon blowout are considered individually; neither presents a likely source of precursors for cosmological GRBs. These envelope constraints could conceivably be circumvented if jets are laterally pressure-confined while traversing the outer stellar envelope. If so, jets responsible for observed GRBs must have been launched from a region several hundred kilometres wide, have been crossed by strong shocks, or have mixed with envelope material as they travel. A phase of pressure confinement and mixing would imprint correlations among jets that may explain observed GRB variability-luminosity and lag-luminosity correlations.},

In a recent paper, we showed that ionizing radiation pressure onto BLR clouds affects virial BH mass estimates and we provided empirically calibrated corrections. More recently, a new test of the importance of radiation forces has been proposed: the M BH-σrelation has been used to estimate M BH for a sample of type-2 AGNs and virial relations (with and without radiation pressure) for a sample of type-1 AGNs extracted from the same parent population. The observed L/L Edd distribution based on virial BH masses is in good agreement with that based on M BH-σonly if radiation pressure effects are negligible, otherwise significant discrepancies are observed. In this Letter, we investigate the effects of intrinsic dispersions associated with the virial relations providing M BH, and we show that they explain the discrepancies between the observed L/L Edd distributions of type-1 and type-2 AGNs. These discrepancies in the L/L Edd distributions are present regardless of the general importance of radiation forces, which must be negligible only for a small fraction of sources with large L/L Edd. Average radiation pressure corrections should then be applied in virial M BH estimators until their dependence on observed source physical properties has been fully calibrated. Finally, the comparison between M BH and L/L Edd distributions derived from σ-based and virial estimators can constrain the variance of BLR physical properties in AGNs.},

We model the light curves as a continuous time stochastic process, providing a natural means of estimating the characteristic timescale and amplitude of quasar variations. We employ a Bayesian approach to estimate the characteristic timescale and amplitude of flux variations; our approach is not affected by biases introduced from discrete sampling effects. We find that the characteristic timescales strongly correlate with black hole mass and luminosity, and are consistent with disk orbital or thermal timescales. In addition, the amplitude of short-timescale variations is significantly anticorrelated with black hole mass and luminosity. We interpret the optical flux fluctuations as resulting from thermal fluctuations that are driven by an underlying stochastic process, such as a turbulent magnetic field. In addition, the intranight variations in optical flux implied by our empirical model are lsim0.02 mag, consistent with current microvariability observations of radio-quiet quasars. Our stochastic model is therefore able to unify both long- and short-timescale optical variations in radio-quiet quasars as resulting from the same underlying process, while radio-loud quasars have an additional variability component that operates on timescales lsim1 day.},

	N2 = {Many active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit a highly variable luminosity. Some AGNs also show a pronounced time delay between variations seen in their optical continuum and in their emission lines. In effect, the emission lines are light echoes of the continuum. This light-travel time delay provides a characteristic radius of the region producing the emission lines. The cross-correlation function (CCF) is the standard tool used to measure the time lag between the continuum and line variations. For the few well-sampled AGNs, the lag is \~{}1-100 days, depending upon which line is used and the luminosity of the AGN. In the best sampled AGN, NGC 5548, the Hβlag shows year-to-year changes, ranging from \~{}8.7 to \~{}22.9 days over a span of 8 years. In this paper it is demonstrated that, in the context of AGN variability studies, the lag estimate using the CCF is biased too low and subject to a large variance. Thus the year-to-year changes of the measured lag in NGC 5548 do not necessarily imply changes in the AGN structure. The bias and large variance are consequences of finite-duration sampling and the dominance of long timescale trends in the light curves, not of noise or irregular sampling. Lag estimates can be substantially improved by removing low-frequency power from the light curves prior to computing the CCF.},

We feature results for NGC 4051 here because, until now, this object has been a significant outlier from AGN scaling relationships, e.g., it was previously a \~{}2-3σoutlier on the relationship between the broad-line region (BLR) radius and the optical continuum luminosity---the R BLR-L relationship. Our new measurements of the lag time between variations in the continuum and Hβemission line made from spectroscopic monitoring of NGC 4051 lead to a measured BLR radius of R BLR = 1.87+0.54 -0.50 light days and black hole mass of M BH = (1.73+0.55 -0.52) ×106 M sun. This radius is consistent with that expected from the R BLR-L relationship, based on the present luminosity of NGC 4051 and the most current calibration of the relation by Bentz et al.. We also present a preliminary look at velocity-resolved Hβlight curves and time delay measurements, although we are unable to reconstruct an unambiguous velocity-resolved reverberation signal.},

The only significant difference between these two sets of data is that the mean Hβflux is higher for 1972-1988. While the Hβprofile can vary dramatically on timescales of months to years, the mean profiles for these two periods are similar, but not identical. We searched for correlations among Hβprofile parameters (such as line width, line centroid, blue-to-red ratio of the line wing fluxes) and investigated their relationship to the continuum flux. Only trivial correlations were found, specifically the correlation between continuum and line fluxes and the anticorrelation between line width and line flux, the latter following from the former and from the inverse correlation between line time lag and line width expected for gravitationally dominated motion.},

Our sample is drawn from the literature, with X-ray data from ROSAT and Chandra, and optical data mostly from the SDSS; 153 of these sources have estimates of ΓX from Chandra. We estimate MBH using standard estimates derived from the Hβ, Mg II, and C IV broad emission lines. Our sample spans a broad range in black hole mass (106<\~{}MBH/Msolar<\~{}1010), redshift (0<z<4.8), and luminosity (1043<\~{}λLλ(2500 {\AA}){$[$}ergs s-1{$]$}<\~{}1048). We find that αox increases with increasing MBH and LUV/LEdd and decreases with increasing LX/LEdd. In addition, we confirm the correlation seen in previous studies between ΓX and MBH and both LUV/LEdd and LX/LEdd; however, we also find evidence that the dependence of ΓX of these quantities is not monotonic, changing sign at MBH\~{}3×108 Msolar. We argue that the αox correlations imply that the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted by the accretion disk, as compared to the corona, increases with increasing accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate, {\.m}. In addition, we argue that the ΓX trends are caused by a dependence of X-ray spectral index on {\.m}. We discuss our results within the context of accretion models with Comptonizing corona and discuss the implications of the αox correlations for quasar feedback. To date, this is the largest study of the dependence of RQQ X-ray parameters on black hole mass and related quantities, and the first to attempt to correct for the large statistical uncertainty in the broad-line mass estimates.},

We consider the case where continuous star formation with a constant rate takes place in a stellar system over 1010 Gyr and the case of a starburst in which the same mass of stars is formed over 109 Gyr. The evolution of the number of white dwarfs is compared with the evolution of the rate of events that are usually considered as SNe Ia and/or accretion-induced collapses, i.e., the accumulation of a Chandrasekhar mass by white dwarfs or the merger of white dwarf pairs with a total mass greater than or equal to the Chandrasekhar one. In stellar systems with a starburst, the supersoft X-ray sources observed at t = 1010 yr are most likely not the progenitors of SNe Ia. The same is true for a significant fraction of the sources in systems with a constant star formation rate. In both cases, the merger of white dwarfs is the dominant mechanism of SNe Ia. In symbiotic binaries, accreting CO dwarfs do not accumulate enough mass for an SNe Ia explosion, while ONeMg dwarfs finish their evolution by an accretion-induce collapse with the formation of a neutron star.},

This scenario, however, has two long-standing problems. First, the explosions do not naturally produce the correct mix of elements, but have to be finely tuned to proceed from subsonic deflagration to supersonic detonation. Second, population models and observations give formation rates of near-Chandrasekhar WDs that are far too small. Here, we suggest that SNe Ia instead result from mergers of roughly equal-mass CO WDs, including those that produce sub-Chandrasekhar mass remnants. Numerical studies of such mergers have shown that the remnants consist of rapidly rotating cores that contain most of the mass and are hottest in the center, surrounded by dense, small disks. We argue that the disks accrete quickly, and that the resulting compressional heating likely leads to central carbon ignition. This ignition occurs at densities for which pure detonations lead to events similar to SNe Ia. With this merger scenario, we can understand the type Ia rates and have plausible reasons for the observed range in luminosity and for the bias of more luminous supernovae toward younger populations. We speculate that explosions of WDs slowly brought to the Chandrasekhar limit---which should also occur---are responsible for some of the "atypical" SNe Ia.},

Calculations employing N of about 10 exp 6-7 are straightforward on existing supercomputers, making possible simulations having significantly smoother fields than with direct methods such as tree-codes. Orbits are found in a given static or time-dependent gravitational field; the potential, phi(r, t) is revised from the resultant density, rho(r, t). Possible scientific uses of this technique are discussed, including tidal perturbations of dwarf galaxies, the adiabatic growth of central masses in spheroidal galaxies, instabilities in realistic galaxy models, and secular processes in galactic evolution.},

The semianalytic method is tested successfully against N-body simulations and then applied to three representative astronomical applications. First, we show how streamer properties can be used to estimate mass-to-light ratios Υand streamer ages of totally disrupted satellites, and we apply the method to the stellar arc in NGC 5907. Second, we discuss how the lack of observed tidal debris around a satellite can provide an upper limit on its mass-loss rate and, as an example, derive the implied limits on mass-loss rates for M32 and NGC 205 around Andromeda. Finally, we point out that a statistical analysis of streamer properties might be applied to test and refine cosmological models of hierarchical galaxy formation, and we use the predicted debris from a standard Λcold dark matter realization to test the feasibility of such a study. Using the Local Group satellites and the few known examples of debris trails in the Galaxy and in external systems, we estimate that the best current techniques could characterize the brightest (R<29 mag arcsec-2) portions of the youngest (3 dynamical periods) debris streamers. If systematics can be controlled, planned large-aperture telescopes such as CELT and OWL may allow fainter trails to be detected routinely and thus may be used for statistical studies such as those required for tests of galaxy formation.},

In the first part of this work, a linear analysis is presented of the instability, which is local and extremely powerful; the maximum growth rate, which is of the order of the angular rotation velocity, is independent of the strength of the magnetic field. Fluid motions associated with the instability directly generate both poloidal and toroidal field components. In the second part of this investigation, the scaling relation between the instability's wavenumber and the Alfven velocity is demonstrated, and the independence of the maximum growth rate from magnetic field strength is confirmed.},

The updated orbit has an even larger eccentricity of 0.966, an epoch of pericenter two months later than estimated before, and a nominal minimum distance of 2200 Schwarzschild radii only. The velocity gradient of G2 has developed further to 600 km s-1 FWHM in summer 2012. We also detect the tail of similar total flux and on the same orbit as G2 along the trajectory at high significance. No hydrodynamic effects are detected yet, since the simple model of a tidally shearing gas cloud still describes the data very well. The flux of G2 has not changed by more than 10{\%} between 2008 and 2012, disfavoring models where additional gas from a reservoir is released to the disrupting diffuse gas component.},

In this letter, we calculate the radio emission from the forward and reverse shock if G2 is a momentum-supported bow shock of a faint star with a high mass-loss rate as suggested by Scoville \& Burkert (2013); Ballone et al. (2013). We show that the radio flux lies well below the quiescent radio flux of Sgr A* and will be difficult to detect. By contrast, in the cloud model of G2, the radio flux of the forward shock is predicted to be much larger than the quiescent radio flux and therefore should have already been detected (Narayan et al. 2012; Sadowski et al. 2013b). Therefore, radio measurements can reveal the nature of G2 well before G2 completes its periapsis passage.},

New, very sensitive data were taken in 2013 April with NACO and SINFONI at the ESO VLT. The "head" of G2 continues to be stretched ever further along the orbit in position-velocity space. A fraction of its emission appears to be already emerging on the blueshifted side of the orbit, past pericenter approach. Ionized gas in the head is now stretched over more than 15,000 Schwarzschild radii R S around the pericenter of the orbit, at ≈2000 R S ≈20 light hours from the black hole. The pericenter passage of G2 will be a process stretching over a period of at least one year. The Brackett-γluminosity of the head has been constant over the past nine years, to within $\pm$25{\%}, as have the line ratios Brackett-γ/Paschen-αand Brackett-γ/Helium-I. We do not see any significant evidence for deviations of G2's dynamical evolution due to hydrodynamical interactions with the hot gas around the black hole from a ballistic orbit of an initially compact cloud with moderate velocity dispersion. The constant luminosity and the increasingly stretched appearance of the head of G2 in the position-velocity plane, without a central peak, is not consistent with several proposed models with continuous gas release from an initially bound zone around a faint star on the same orbit as G2.},

We present hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of different spherically symmetric winds of a stellar object embedded in G2. We find that the interaction with the ambient medium and the extreme gravitational field of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center must be taken into account in such a source scenario. The thermal pressure of the hot and dense atmosphere confines the wind, while its ram pressure shapes it via stripping along the orbit, with the details depending on the wind parameters. Tidal forces squeeze the wind near pericenter, reducing it to a thin and elongated filament. We also find that in this scenario most of the Brγluminosity is expected to come from the densest part of the wind, which has a highly filamentary structure with a low filling factor. For our assumed atmosphere, the observations can be best matched by a mass outflow rate of \dot{\{}M{\}}{\{}{\_}w{\}}=8.8\times 10\^{}{\{}-8{\}}\, M{\_}{\{}\odot {\}} \;yr\^{}{\{}-1{\}} and a wind velocity of v w = 50 km s-1. These values are comparable with those of a young T Tauri star wind, as already suggested by Scoville \& Burkert.},

The observations were obtained with the laser guide star adaptive optics systems on the W. M. Keck I and II telescopes (2006-2012) and include spectroscopy (R \~{} 3600) centered on the hydrogen Brγline as well as K' (2.1 μm) and L' (3.8 μm) imaging. Analysis of these observations shows the Brγline emission has a positional offset from the L' continuum. This offset is likely due to background source confusion at L'. We therefore present the first orbital solution derived from Brγline astrometry, which, when coupled with radial velocity measurements, results in a later time of closest approach (2014.21 $\pm$0.14), closer periastron (130 AU, 1600 R s), and higher eccentricity (0.9814 $\pm$0.0060) compared to a solution using L' astrometry. It is shown that G2 has no K' counterpart down to K' \~{} 20 mag. G2's L' continuum and the Brγline emission appears unresolved in almost all epochs, which implies that the bulk of the emission resides in a compact region. The observations altogether suggest that while G2 has a gaseous component that is tidally interacting with the central black hole, there is likely a central star providing the self-gravity necessary to sustain the compact nature of this object.},

	N2 = {We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transient PS1-11af, which was also detected by GALEX with coordinated observations in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band. PS1-11af is associated with the nucleus of an early-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for star formation or AGN activity. Four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair of transient broad absorption features in the UV on otherwise featureless spectra. Despite the superficial similarity of these features to P-Cygni absorptions of supernovae (SNe), we conclude that PS1-11af is not consistent with the properties of known types of SNe. Blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a SN, and the velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material in homologous expansion near a SN photosphere. However, the constant blue colors and slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selected tidal disruption events (TDEs). The shape of the optical light curve is consistent with models for TDEs, but the minimum accreted mass necessary to power the observed luminosity is only \~{}0.002M{\_}sun, which points to a partial disruption model. A full disruption model predicts higher bolometric luminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in a separate component at high energies where we lack observations. In addition, the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion disk models for TDEs and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature. Three deep non-detections in the radio with the VLA over the first two years after the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflow comparable to Swift J1644+57, even if off-axis.},

Our formalism differs in two significant ways from a similar 3.5 post-Newtonian approach proposed by Blanchet. First, we concentrate only on the radiation-reaction effects produced by a time-varying mass-current quadrupole Sij. Second, we adopt a gauge in which the radiation-reaction force densities depend on the fourth time derivative of Sij, rather than on the fifth, as in Blanchet's approach. This difference makes our formalism particularly well-suited to numerical implementation and could prove useful in performing fully numerical simulations of the recently discovered r-mode instability for rotating neutron stars subject to axial perturbations.},

	N2 = {Rossby waves (r-modes) in rapidly rotating neutron stars are unstable because of the emission of gravitational radiation. As a result, the stellar rotational energy is converted into both gravitational waves and r-mode energy. The saturation level for the r-mode energy is a fundamental parameter needed to determine how fast the neutron star spins down, as well as whether gravitational waves will be detectable. In this paper we study saturation by nonlinear transfer of energy to the sea of stellar ``inertial'' oscillation modes that arise in rotating stars with negligible buoyancy and elastic restoring forces. We present detailed calculations of stellar inertial modes in the WKB limit, their linear damping by bulk and shear viscosity, and the nonlinear coupling forces among these modes. The saturation amplitude is derived in the extreme limits of strong or weak driving by radiation reaction, as compared to the damping rate of low-order inertial modes. In the weak driving case, energy can be stably transferred to a small number of modes, which damp the energy as heat or neutrinos. In the strong driving case, we show that a turbulent cascade develops, with a constant flux of energy to large wavenumbers and small frequencies where it is damped by shear viscosity. We find that the saturation energy is extremely small, at least 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that found by previous investigators. We show that the large saturation energy found in the simulations of Lindblom and coworkers is an artifact of their unphysically large radiation reaction force. In most physical situations of interest, for either nascent, rapidly rotating neutron stars or neutron stars being spun up by accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), the strong driving limit is appropriate and the saturation energy is roughly Er-mode/(0.5Mr2*Ω2)\~{}=0.1γgr/Ω\~{}=10-6(νspin/103Hz)5, where M and r* are the stellar mass and radius, respectively, γgr is the driving rate by gravitational radiation, Ωis the angular velocity of the star, and νspin is the spin frequency. At such a low saturation amplitude, the characteristic time for the star to exit the region of r-mode instability is >\~{}103-104 yr, depending sensitively on the instability curve. Although our saturation amplitude is smaller than that found by previous investigators, it is still sufficiently large to explain the observed period clustering in LMXBs. We find that the r-mode signal from both newly born neutron stars and LMXBs in the spin-down phase of Levin's limit cycle will be detectable by enhanced LIGO detectors out to \~{}100-200 kpc.},

For simplicity the situation is studied first on a βplane. The geometrical conditions for two waves to form a triplet with a given third wave are determined, and so also is the rate of energy transfer. Some conservation theorems are proved. The analysis allows for a non-zero horizontal divergence of the motion. For waves which cover a complete sphere it is shown that the resonant interactions between three different harmonic components take place, if at all, in the neighbourhoods of two latitude circles, situated symmetrically north and south of the equator.},

	N2 = {We describe statistical methods for measuring the exoplanet multiplicity function (the fraction of host stars containing a given number of planets) and inclination distribution from transit and radial-velocity (RV) surveys. The analysis is based on the approximation of separability---that the distribution of planetary parameters in an n-planet system is the product of identical 1-planet distributions. We review the evidence that separability is a valid approximation for exoplanets and conclude that it captures many, but not all, of the known characteristics of multi-planet systems. We show how to relate the observable multiplicity function in surveys with similar host-star populations but different sensitivities. We also show how to correct for geometrical selection effects to derive the multiplicity function from transit surveys if the distribution of relative inclinations is known. Applying these tools to the Kepler transit survey and to RV surveys, we find that (1) the Kepler data alone do not constrain the mean inclination of multi-planet systems; even spherical distributions are allowed by the data but only if a small fraction of host stars contain large planet populations (gsim 30); (2) comparing the Kepler and RV surveys shows that the mean inclination of multi-planet systems is less than 5$\,^{\circ}$and (3) the multiplicity function of the Kepler planets is not well determined by the present data.},

The stellar disk generates accretion power at super-Eddington rates and the observational properties of Sw J1644+57 indicate---in analogy with ULXs---that the accretion flow maintains a high level of radiative efficiency with a corresponding super-Eddington luminosity. Due to its similarity to ULXs, this powerful transient may be thought of as an ultra-luminous X-ray event (ULX-E). Observational tests for this ULX-E model are proposed as well.},

The cloud is being tidally disrupted along its path to closest approach at \~{}3,100 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole. Here we show that the observed properties of this cloud of gas can naturally be produced by a proto-planetary disc surrounding a low-mass star, which was scattered from the observed ring of young stars orbiting SgrA*. As the young star approaches the black hole, its disc experiences both photoevaporation and tidal disruption, producing a cloud. Our model implies that planets form in the Galactic centre, and that tidal debris from proto-planetary discs can flag low-mass stars, which are otherwise too faint to be detected.},

	N2 = {This paper presents Suzaku results obtained for the Sagittarius (Sgr) C region using the concept of X-ray reflection nebulae (XRNe) as the echo of past flares from a super-massive black hole, Sgr A*. The Sgr C complex is composed of several molecular clouds proximately located in projected distance. The X-ray spectra of Sgr C were analyzed based on the view that XRNe are located inside the Galactic center plasma X-ray emission with an oval distribution around Sgr A*. We found that XRNe are largely separated in the line-of-sight position, and are associated with molecular clouds in different velocity ranges detected by radio observations. We also applied the same analysis to Sgr B XRNe, and completed a long-term light curve for Sgr A* occurring in the past. As a new finding, we determined that Sgr A* has already experienced periods of high luminosity, ˜500 years ago, which is longer than the previously reported value. Our results are consistent with a scenario that Sgr A* was continuously active with sporadic flux variabilities of LX (1-3) ×1039 erg s-1 in the past 50 to 500 years. The average past luminosity was approximately 4-6 orders of magnitude higher than that presently observed. In addition, two short-term flares of 5-10 years have been found. Thus, the past X-ray flare should not be a single short-term flare, but can be interpreted as multiple flares superposed on a long-term high state.},

We first compare the results obtained using two different numerical techniques with different resolutions, and find overall very good agreement. We then compare the outcomes of those simulations with observed systems thought to have gone through a common envelope. The simulations fail to reproduce those systems in the sense that most of the envelope of the donor remains bound at the end of the simulations and the final orbital separations between the donor's remnant and the companion, ranging from 26.8 down to 5.9 \rsun, are larger than the ones observed. We suggest that this discrepancy vouches for recombination playing an essential role in the ejection of the envelope and/or significant shrinkage of the orbit happening in the subsequent phase.},

Tidal disruption events are thought to power luminous but short-lived accretion episodes that can light up otherwise quiescent SMBHs in transient flares. Here we explore a more gradual process of tidal stripping where stars approach the tidal disruption radius by stellar evolution while in an eccentric orbit. After the onset of mass transfer, these stars episodically transfer mass to the SMBH every pericenter passage, giving rise to low-level flares that repeat on the orbital timescale. Giant stars, in particular, will exhibit a runaway response to mass loss and "spoon-feed" material to the black hole for tens to hundreds of orbital periods. In contrast to full tidal disruption events, the duty cycle of this feeding mode is of order unity for black holes M bh >\~{} 107 M \&{\#}9737;. This mode of quasi-steady SMBH feeding is competitive with indirect SMBH feeding through stellar winds, and spoon-fed giant stars may play a role in determining the quiescent luminosity of local SMBHs.},

G2 is a sensitive probe of the hot accretion zone of Sgr A*, requiring gas temperatures and densities that agree well with models of captured shock-heated stellar winds. Its mass is equal to the critical mass below which cold clumps would be destroyed quickly by evaporation. Its mass is also constrained by the fact that at apocenter its sound crossing timescale was equal to its infall timescale. Our numerical simulations show that the observed structure and evolution of G2 can be well reproduced if it forms in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings in 1995 at a distance from the SMBH of 7.6 ×1016 cm. If the cloud had formed at apocenter in the "clockwise" stellar disk as expected from its orbit, it would be torn into a very elongated spaghetti-like filament by 2011, which is not observed. This problem can be solved if G2 is the head of a larger, shell-like structure that formed at apocenter. Our numerical simulations show that this scenario explains not only G2's observed kinematical and geometrical properties but also the Brγobservations of a low surface brightness gas tail that trails the cloud. In 2013, while passing the SMBH, G2 will break up into a string of droplets that within the next 30 years will mix with the surrounding hot gas and trigger cycles of active galactic nucleus activity.},

We show the effects of the rotating accretion flow on the evolution of G2 by projecting the cloud density on to the plane of the sky, and extracting position-velocity diagrams. We study a number of possible orientations of the cloud orbit with respect to the disc. We find that once the centre of mass of the cloud has crossed the pericentre, the differences between models become significant. Models with the cloud counterrotating with respect to the disc are expected to reach higher blueshifted line-of-sight velocities. The spatial extent of the emission depends strongly on the cloud-to-disc inclination angle. Future imaging and spectroscopy of G2 emission will shed light both on the structure of the Sgr A* disc and on the properties of the cloud.},

	N2 = {We calculate the volumetric rate of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) based on five events discovered with the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment-IIIb (ROTSE-IIIb) telescope. We gather light curves of 19 events from the literature and our own unpublished data and employ crude k-corrections to constrain the pseudo-absolute magnitude distributions in the rest-frame ROTSE-IIIb (unfiltered) bandpass for both the hydrogen-poor (SLSN-I) and hydrogen-rich (SLSN-II) populations. We find that the peak magnitudes of the available SLSN-I are narrowly distributed (M = -21.7 $\pm$0.4) in our unfiltered band pass and may suggest an even tighter intrinsic distribution when the effects of dust are considered, although the sample may be skewed by selection and publication biases. The presence of O II features near maximum light may uniquely signal a high-luminosity event, and we suggest further observational and theoretical work is warranted to assess the possible utility of such SN 2005ap-like SLSN-I as distance indicators. Using the pseudo-absolute magnitude distributions derived from the light-curve sample, we measure the SLSN-I rate to be about (32 {\{}\^{}{\{}+ 77{\}}{\_}{\{}-26{\}}{\}} ) events Gpc-3 yr-1 h371 at a weighted redshift of overline{\{}z{\}} = 0.17, and the SLSN-II rate to be about (151 {\{}\^{}{\{}+ 151{\}}{\_}{\{}-82{\}}{\}} ) events Gpc-3 yr-1 h371 at overline{\{}z{\}} = 0.15. Given that the exact nature and limits of these populations are still unknown, we discuss how it may be difficult to distinguish these rare SLSNe from other transient phenomena such as active galactic nucleus activity and tidal disruption events even when multiband photometry, spectroscopy or even high-resolution imaging are available. Including one spectroscopically peculiar event, we determine a total rate for SLSN-like events of (199 {\{}\^{}{\{}+ 137{\}}{\_}{\{}-86{\}}{\}} ) events Gpc-3 yr-1 h371 at overline{\{}z{\}} = 0.16.},

Since our survey is flux limited and thus biased against fainter objects, the pseudo-absolute magnitude distribution (pAMD) of SNe Ia in a given volume is an important concern, especially the relative frequency of high- to low-luminosity SNe Ia. We find that the pAMD derived from the volume-limited Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) sample is incompatible with the distribution of SNe Ia in a volume-limited (z < 0.12) sub-sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II). The LOSS sample requires far more low-luminosity SNe Ia than the SDSS-II can accommodate. Even though LOSS and SDSS-II have sampled different SNe Ia populations, their volumetric rates are surprisingly similar. Using the same model pAMD adopted in the SDSS-II SNe Ia rate calculation and excluding two high-luminosity SNe Ia from our sample, we derive a rate that is marginally higher than previous low-redshift determinations. With our full sample and the LOSS pAMD, our rate is more than double the canonical value. We also find that 5 of our 18 SNe Ia are hosted by very low luminosity (MB > -16) galaxies, whereas only 1 out of 79 nearby SDSS-II SNe Ia have such faint hosts. It is possible that previous works have undercounted either low-luminosity SNe Ia, SNe Ia in low-luminosity hosts, or peculiar SNe Ia (sometimes explicitly), and the total SNe Ia rate may be higher than the canonical value.},

With the exception of modest X-ray and infrared flares, Sgr A* is surprisingly faint, suggesting that the accretion rate and radiation efficiency near the event horizon are currently very low. Here we report the presence of a dense gas cloud approximately three times the mass of Earth that is falling into the accretion zone of Sgr A*. Our observations tightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermost radius of approach of only \~{}3,100 times the event horizon that will be reached in 2013. Over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probably mainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitational force. The cloud's dynamic evolution and radiation in the next few years will probe the properties of the accretion flow and the feeding processes of the supermassive black hole. The kilo-electronvolt X-ray emission of Sgr A* may brighten significantly when the cloud reaches pericentre. There may also be a giant radiation flare several years from now if the cloud breaks up and its fragments feed gas into the central accretion zone.},

	N2 = {Using three-dimensional, moving-mesh simulations, we investigate the future evolution of the recently discovered gas cloud G2 traveling through the galactic center. We consider the case of a spherical cloud initially in pressure equilibrium with the background. Our suite of simulations explores the following parameters: the equation of state, radial profiles of the background gas, and start times for the evolution. Our primary focus is on how the fate of this cloud will affect the future activity of Sgr A*. From our simulations we expect an average feeding rate in the range of (5-19) ×10-8 M ⊙yr-1 beginning in 2013 and lasting for at least 7 years (our simulations stop in year 2020). The accretion varies by less than a factor of three on timescales <=1 month, and shows no more than a factor of 10 difference between the maximum and minimum observed rates within any given model. These rates are comparable to the current estimated accretion rate in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A*, although they represent only a small (lsim 5{\%}) increase over the current expected feeding rate at the effective inner boundary of our simulations (r = 750, RS ≈1015 cm), where RS is the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole. Therefore, the breakup of cloud G2 may have only a minimal effect on the brightness and variability of Sgr A* over the next decade. This is because current models of the galactic center predict that most of the gas will be caught up in outflows. However, if the accreted G2 material can remain cold, it may not mix well with the hot, diffuse background gas, and instead accrete efficiently onto Sgr A*. Further observations of G2 will give us an unprecedented opportunity to test this idea. The breakup of the cloud itself may also be observable. By tracking the amount of cloud energy that is dissipated during our simulations, we are able to get a rough estimate of the luminosity associated with its tidal disruption; we find values of a few 1036 erg s-1.},

	N2 = {We investigate the origin and fate of the recently discovered gas cloud G2 close to the Galactic center. Our hydrodynamical simulations focusing on the dynamical evolution of the cloud in combination with currently available observations favor two scenarios: a Compact Cloud which started around the year 1995 and a Spherical Shell of gas, with an apocenter distance within the disk(s) of young stars and a radius of a few times the size of the Compact Cloud. The former is able to explain the detected signal of G2 in the position-velocity (PV) diagram of the Brγemission of the year 2008.5 and 2011.5 data. The latter can account for both G2's signal as well as the fainter extended tail-like structure G2t seen at larger distances from the black hole and smaller velocities. In contrast, gas stripped from a compact cloud by hydrodynamical interactions is not able to explain the location of the detected G2t emission in the observed PV diagrams. This favors the Spherical Shell Scenario and might be a severe problem for the Compact Cloud as well as the so-called Compact Source Scenario. From these first idealized simulations, we expect a roughly constant feeding of the supermassive black hole through a nozzle-like structure over a long period, starting shortly after the closest approach in 2013.51 for the Compact Cloud. If the matter accretes in the hot accretion mode, we do not expect a significant boost of the current activity of Sgr A* for the Compact Cloud model, but a boost of the average infrared and X-ray luminosity by roughly a factor of 80 for the Spherical Shell Scenario with order of magnitude variations on a timescale of a few months. Assuming that a part of the gas is accreted in cold disk mode, even higher boost factors can be reached. The near-future evolution of the cloud will be a sensitive probe of the conditions of the gas distribution in the milli-parsec environment of the massive black hole in the Galactic center.},

We calculate the dynamics near the outer edge of the disc, which contains the majority of the disc's mass and determines the accretion rate on to the central black hole. This treatment allows us to follow the evolution over much longer time-scales (100s or longer) than current hydrodynamic simulations. At late times the disc becomes advective and its properties asymptote to self-similar solutions with an accretion rate (neglecting outflows). This late-time accretion can in principle provide sufficient energy to power the late-time activity observed by Swift from some short-duration gamma-ray bursts. However, because outflows during the advective phase unbind the majority of the remaining mass, it is difficult for the remnant disc alone to produce significant accretion power well beyond the onset of the advective phase. Unless the viscosity is quite low (α<\~{} 10-3), this occurs before the start of observed flaring at \~{}30s continued mass inflow at late times thus appears required to explain the late-time activity from short-duration gamma-ray bursts. We show that the composition of the disc freezes-out when the disc is relatively neutron rich (electron fraction Ye \~{}= 0.3). Roughly 10-2Msolar of this neutron-rich material is ejected by winds at late times. During earlier, neutrino-cooled phases of accretion, neutrino irradiation of the disc produces a wind with Ye \~{}= 0.5, which synthesizes at most \~{}10-3Msolar of 56Ni. We highlight what conditions are favorable for 56Ni production and predict, in the best cases, optical and infrared transients peaking \~{}0.5-2d after the burst, with fluxes a factor of \~{}10 below the current observational limits.},

The pre-Swift paradigm of achromatic, shallow-to-steep "breaks" in the long-term GRB light curves has not been borne out by detailed Swift data amassed in the past several years. We argue that, given the initial existence of a fall-back disk near the progenitor, an unavoidable consequence will be the formation of an "external disk" whose outer edge continually moves to larger radii due to angular momentum transport and lack of a confining torque. The mass reservoir at large radii moves outward with time and gives a natural power-law decay to the GRB light curves. In this model, the different canonical power-law decay segments in the GRB identified by Zhang et al. and Nousek et al. represent different physical states of the accretion disk. We identify a physical disk state with each power-law segment.},

M. Keck I 10 m telescope. Within our limiting magnitude of mK<16 mag for images made from a single night of data, we find a minimum of 15 K{$[$}2.2 μm{$]$}-band variable stars out of 131 monitored stars. The only periodic source in our sample is the previously identified variable IRS 16SW, for which we measure an orbital period of 19.448+/-0.002 days. In contrast to recent results, our data on IRS 16SW show an asymmetric phased light curve with a much steeper fall time than rise time, which may be due to tidal deformations caused by the proximity of the stars in their orbits. We also identify a possible wind colliding binary (IRS 29N) based on its photometric variation over a few year timescale, which is likely due to episodic dust production. None of the four luminous blue variable (LBV) candidates in our sample show the characteristic large increase or decrease in luminosity. However, our time baseline is too short to rule them out as LBVs. Among the remaining variable stars, the majority are early-type stars, and three are possibly variable due to line-of-sight extinction variations. For the seven OB stars at the center of our field of view that have well-determined three-dimensional orbits, we see no evidence of flares or dimming of their light, which limits the possibility of a cold, geometrically thin, inactive accretion disk around the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*.},

We find evidence on a >=2 σlevel for radial anisotropy of the cluster of stars within 1" of Sgr A*. For a brightness limit of K\~{}15.5, we find no evidence for a stationary source at the position of Sgr A* or for a source at this position that would be variable on a timescale of at least several hours to days. On timescales of seconds to tens of minutes, we find no variability at the Sgr A* position on brightness levels K<=13.5. We confirm/find accelerated motion for six stars, with four stars having passed the pericenter of their orbits during the observed time span. We calculated/constrained the orbital parameters of these stars. All orbits have moderate to high eccentricities. We discuss the possible bias in detecting preferentially orbits with high eccentricities and find that measured values of e>0.9 might be detected by about a factor of 1.5-2 more frequently. We find that the center of acceleration for all the orbits coincides with the radio position of Sgr A*. From the orbit of the star S2, the currently most tightly constrained one, we determine the mass of Sgr A* to be (3.3+/-0.7)×106 Msolar and its position to 2.0+/-2.4 mas east and 2.7+/-4.5 mas south of the nominal radio position. The mass estimate for the central dark mass from the orbit of S2 is fully consistent with the mass estimate of (3.4+/-0.5)×106 Msolar obtained from stellar proper motions within 1.2" of Sgr A* using a Leonard-Merritt mass estimator. We find that radio astronomical observations of the proper motion of Sgr A*, in combination with its intrinsic source size, place at the moment the tightest constraints on the mass density of Sgr A*, which must exceed ρSgrA*>3×1019 Msolar pc-3.

Tidal effects may play an important part in this angular momentum transport. Here the angular momentum transfer in a star-disk encounter is investigated numerically for a variety of encounter parameters in the case of low-mass disks. Although good agreement is found with analytical results for the entire disk, the loss inside the disk can be up to an order of magnitude higher than previously assumed. The differences in angular momentum transport caused by secondary stars on hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptical paths are shown, and it is found that a succession of distant encounters might be equally, if not more, successful in removing angular momentum than a single close encounter.},

	N2 = {Young stars display evidence of moderately massive, centrifugally supported, gaseous, and dusty circumstellar disks. These disks are highly susceptible to compressional and transverse disturbances. Such density and bending waves may be excited by tidal forces from external gravitational perturbers, including passing, initially unbound stars. The energy and angular momentum exchange between the two-body orbit and the disk permits capture of passing stars on near-parabolic orbits, and can cause disk accretion. We compute energy and angular momentum transfer for near-parabolic orbits with periastron xmin beyond two disk radii rD, as a function of relative disk-orbit angles, using linear perturbation theory. We present both numerical evaluation of the integrations and asymptotic analytic results. These are used to compute capture rates and induced accretion rates in stellar clusters. We find that for encounters with xmin near 2rD, the disk angular momentum is reduced by a few to several percent (angle-averaged), with prograde, coplanar orientations yielding reductions by more than 10{\%}. For typical open cluster parameters, the capture probability is less than 0.1{\%} at xmin approximately 2rD; for most orientations energy is actually given to the perturber, rather than the reverse. Capture is permitted only for polar and retrograde encounters, and even then is unlikely. In particular, the asymptotic analytic results (large xmin/rD limit) for resonant transfer predict that the disk's energy change will be positive for inclinations greater than 101.5 deg, with the maximum, positive value at inclination 117 deg only 1{\%} of the (negative) disk energy change at zero inclination. Both the angular momentum transfer and the capture probability drop off with increasing xmin/rD, first as an exponential and then as a power law. We explain this behavior in terms of the ratio of perturbed angular velocity to disk angular velocities, and the spectrum of allowed resonances. We compare our results on star/disk-star encounters with other capture calculations, and find that many of the same considerations also apply to star-star encounters and galaxy-galaxy encounters.},

	N2 = {While a white dwarf is, from a theoretical perspective, the most plausible primary star in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), many other candidates have not been formally ruled out. Shock energy deposited in the envelope of any exploding primary contributes to the early SN brightness and, since this radiation energy is degraded by expansion after the explosion, the diffusive luminosity depends on the initial primary radius. We present a new non-detection limit of the nearby SN Ia 2011fe, obtained what appears to be just 4 hours after explosion, allowing us to directly constrain the initial primary radius, R{\_}p. Coupled with the non-detection of a quiescent X-ray counterpart and the inferred synthesized Ni mass, we show that R{\_}p <\~{} 0.02 R{\_}sun (a factor of 5 smaller than previously inferred), that the average density of the primary must be rho{\_}p > 10,000 gm cm\^{}{\{}-3{\}}, and that the effective temperature must be less than a few x 10\^{}5 K. This rules out hydrogen burning main sequence stars and giants. Constructing the helium-burning main sequence and carbon-burning main sequence, we find such objects are also excluded. By process of elimination, we find that only degeneracy-supported compact objects---WDs and neutron stars---are viable as the primary star of SN 2011fe. With few caveats, we also restrict the companion (secondary) star radius to R{\_} c <\~{} 0.1 R{\_}sun, excluding Roche-Lobe overflowing red giant and main-sequence companions to high significance.},

Consideration is given only to the case of spherical clouds, where the evaporative mass-loss rate is an eigenvalue of the time-independent energy-conservation equation. The upper bound on the heat flux which may be carried by electrons is found to be smaller than previously expected, it is assumed that the exact heat flux should closely approximate this maximum value in collisionless gases, and such a theory is shown to give good numerical agreement with solar-wind observations. A straightforward solution is obtained for those cases where the classical thermal-conduction formula is applicable throughout the interface, and limitations are given under which analytic solutions can be found when the classical formula does not apply throughout the interface. The results of the present theory are compared with those of a previous and less accurate analysis which considered conducting fronts analogous to ionization fronts. Cloud evaporation within supernova remnants is discussed, and it is concluded that the present results should provide a reasonable approximation even in such an extreme case.},

	N2 = {Over a 2 year period we have conducted a diffraction-limited imaging study at 2.2 μm of the inner 6" x 6" of the central stellar cluster of the Galaxy using the W. M. Keck 10 m telescope. The K-band images obtained in 1995 June, 1996 June, and 1997 May have the highest angular resolution obtained at near-infrared wavelengths from ground or space (theta{\_}res = 0.05" = 0.002 pc) and reveal a large population of faint stars. We use an unbiased approach for identifying and selecting stars to be included in this proper-motion study, which results in a sample of 90 stars with brightness ranging from K = 9-17 mag and two-dimensional velocities as large as 1400 +/- 100 km s\^{}-1. Compared to earlier work (Eckart et al. 1997; Genzel et al. 1997), the source confusion is reduced by a factor of 9, the number of stars with proper-motion measurement in the central 25 arcsec\^{}2 of our Galaxy is doubled, and the accuracy of the velocity measurements in the central 1 arcsec\^{}2 is improved by a factor of 4. The peaks of both the stellar surface density and the velocity dispersion are consistent with the position of the unusual radio source and black hole candidate Sgr A*, which suggests that Sgr A* is coincident (+/-0.1") with the dynamical center of the Galaxy. As a function of distance from Sgr A*, the velocity dispersion displays a falloff well-fitted by Keplerian motion (sigma{\_}v \~{} r\^{}-0.5+/-0.1) about a central dark mass of 2.6 +/- 0.2 x 10\^{}6 M{\_}⊙confined to a volume of at most 10\^{}-6 pc\^{}3, which is consistent with earlier results. Although uncertainties in the measurements mathematically allow for the matter to be distributed over this volume as a cluster, no realistic cluster is physically tenable. Thus, independent of the presence of Sgr A*, the large inferred central density of at least 10\^{}12 M{\_}⊙pc\^{}-3, which exceeds the volume-averaged mass densities found at the center of any other galaxy, leads us to the conclusion that our Galaxy harbors a massive central black hole.},

Using laser guide star adaptive optics in conjunction with the integral field spectrograph, OSIRIS, at the Keck II telescope, we are able to differentiate between the older, late-type (\~{} 1 Gyr) stars, which are presumed to be dynamically relaxed, and the unrelaxed young (\~{} 6 Myr) population. This distinction is crucial for testing models of stellar cusp formation in the vicinity of a black hole, as the models assume that the cusp stars are in dynamical equilibrium in the black hole potential. In the survey region, we classified 60 stars as early-type (22 newly identified) and 74 stars as late-type (61 newly identified). We find that contamination from young stars is significant, with more than twice as many young stars as old stars in our sensitivity range (K' < 15.5) within the central arcsecond. Based on the late-type stars alone, the surface stellar number density profile, Σ(R) vprop R -Γ, is flat, with Γ= -0.27 $\pm$0.19. Monte Carlo simulations of the possible de-projected volume density profile, n(r) vpropr -γ, show that γis less than 1.0 at the 99.7{\%} confidence level. These results are consistent with the nuclear star cluster having no cusp, with a core profile that is significantly flatter than that predicted by most cusp formation theories, and even allows for the presence of a central hole in the stellar distribution. Of the possible dynamical interactions that can lead to the depletion of the red giants observable in this survey---stellar collisions, mass segregation from stellar remnants, or a recent merger event---mass segregation is the only one that can be ruled out as the dominant depletion mechanism. The lack of a stellar cusp around a supermassive black hole would have important implications for black hole growth models and inferences on the presence of a black hole based upon stellar distributions.},

	N2 = {The Galactic center offers us an opportunity to study the environment around a supermassive black hole at a level of detail not possible in other galactic nuclei. This potential has been greatly expanded by the implementation of laser guide star adaptive optics and integral field spectroscopy on large ground-based telescopes. This thesis takes advantage of these technologies to address the nature of the variable near-infrared emission from the black hole as well as test theories of the equilibrium configuration of a star cluster with a supermassive black hole at its center. First, we present the results of near-infrared (2 and 3 micron) monitoring of Sgr A*-IR with 1 min time sampling. Sgr A*-IR was observed continuously for up to three hours on each of seven nights, between 2005 July and 2007 August. Sgr A*-IR is detectable at all times and is continuously variable, with a median observed 2 micron flux density of 0.192 mJy, corresponding to 16.3 magnitude at K\^{}'. These observations allow us to investigate Nyquist sampled periods ranging from about 2 minutes to an hour. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the variability of Sgr A* in this data set is consistent with models based on correlated noise with power spectra having frequency dependent power law slopes between 2.0 to 3.0, consistent with those reported for AGN light curves. Of particular interest are periods of ˜20 min, corresponding to a quasi-periodic signal claimed based upon previous near-infrared observations and interpreted as the orbit of a `hot spot' at or near the last stable orbit of a spinning black hole. We find no significant periodicity at any time scale probed in these new observations for periodic signals. This study is sensitive to periodic signals with amplitudes greater than 20{\%} of the maximum amplitude of the underlying red noise component for light curves with duration greater than ˜2 hours at a 98{\%} confidence limit. Second, we report on the structure of the nuclear star cluster in the innermost 0.16 pc of the Galaxy as measured by the number density profile of late-type giants. Using laser guide star adaptive optics in conjunction with the integral field spectrograph, OSIRIS, at the Keck II telescope, we are able to differentiate between the older, late-type (˜1 Gyr) stars, which are presumed to be dynamically relaxed, and the unrelaxed young (˜6 Myr) population. This distinction is crucial for testing models of stellar cusp formation in the vicinity of a black hole, as the models assume that the cusp stars are in dynamical equilibrium in the black hole potential. In the survey region, we classified 77 stars as early-type 79 stars as late-type. We find that contamination from young stars is significant, with more than twice as many young stars as old stars in our sensitivity range (K' < 15.5) within the central arcsecond. Based on the late-type stars alone, the surface stellar number density profile, Σ(R) ∝R(-Γ) , is flat, with Γ= -0.26$\pm$0.24. Monte Carlo simulations of the possible de-projected volume density profile, n(r) ∝r\^{}{\{}-γ{\}}, show that γis less than 1.0 at the 99.7 {\%} confidence level. These results are consistent with the nuclear star cluster having no cusp, with a core profile that is significantly flatter than predicted by most cusp formation theories, and even allows for the presence of a central hole in the stellar distribution. Of the possible dynamical interactions that can lead to the depletion of the red giants observable in this survey - stellar collisions, mass segregation from stellar remnants, or a recent merger event - mass segregation is the only one that can be ruled out as the dominant depletion mechanism. The degeneracy in the true distribution of stars cannot be broken with number counts alone, but we show how the addition of kinematic measurements can remov! e the degeneracy. Resolving the physical origin of the lack of a stellar cusp will have important implications for black hole growth models and inferences on the presence of a black hole based upon stellar distributions.},

We observe that the ratio of helium- to hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs increases gradually from a constant value of \~{}0.25 between Teff=15,000 and 10,000 K to a value twice as large in the range 10,000 K>Teff>8000 K, suggesting that convective mixing, which occurs when the bottom of the hydrogen convection zone reaches the underlying convective helium envelope, is responsible for this gradual transition. The comparison of our results with an approximate model used to describe the outcome of this convective mixing process implies hydrogen mass layers in the range MH/Mtot=10-10 to 10-8 for about 15{\%} of the DA stars that survived the DA-to-DB transition near Teff\~{}30,000 K, the remainder having presumably more massive layers above MH/Mtot\~{}10-6.},

We find that convection plays a crucial role in the burning process when multidimensional effects are taken into account. Temperature fluctuations caused by convective mixing give rise to local enhancement of nuclear burning. Nonsimultaneous eruptions of fast burning, lasting for a few seconds, occur locally at the base of the hydrogen envelope. The convection cells bounded within by the envelope, become violent near such eruption sites and induce further eruptions nearby. The burning process slows down only after enough energy is released and global expansion takes place. Since the flow satys subsonic all through the runaway, the pressure equalizes laterally and the expansion is almost spherically symmetric.},

	N2 = {Context: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are located at the photometric and dynamical centers of the majority of galaxies. They are among the densest star clusters in the Universe. The NSC in the Milky Way is the only object of this class that can be resolved into individual stars. The massive black hole Sagittarius A* is located at the dynamical center of the Milky Way NSC. Aims: In this work we examine the proper motions of stars out to distances of 1.0 pc from Sgr A*. The aim is to examine the velocity structure of the MW NSC and acquire a reliable estimate of the stellar mass in the central parsec of the MW NSC, in addition to the well-known black hole mass. Methods: We use multi-epoch adaptive optics assisted near-infrared observations of the central parsec of the Galaxy obtained with NACO/CONICA at the ESO VLT. Stellar positions are measured via PSF fitting in the individual images and transformed into a common reference frame via suitable sets of reference stars. Results: We measured the proper motions of more than 6000 stars within \~{}1.0 pc of Sagittarius A*. The full data set is provided in this work. We largely exclude the known early-type stars with their peculiar dynamical properties from the dynamical analysis. The cluster is found to rotate parallel to Galactic rotation, while the velocity dispersion appears isotropic (or anisotropy may be masked by the cluster rotation). The Keplerian fall-off of the velocity dispersion due to the point mass of Sgr A* is clearly detectable only at R ⪉0.3 pc. Nonparametric isotropic and anisotropic Jeans models are applied to the data. They imply a best-fit black hole mass of 3.6\^{}+0.2-0.4 ×106 M⊙. Although this value is slightly lower than the current canonical value of 4.0 ×106 M⊙, this is the first time that a proper motion analysis provides a mass for Sagittarius A* that is consistent with the mass inferred from orbits of individual stars. The point mass of Sagittarius A* is not sufficient to explain the velocity data. In addition to the black hole, the models require the presence of an extended mass of 0.5-1.5 ×106 M⊙in the central parsec. This is the first time that the extended mass of the nuclear star cluster is unambiguously detected. The influence of the extended mass on the gravitational potential becomes notable at distances ⪆0.4 pc from Sgr A*. Constraints on the distribution of this extended mass are weak. The extended mass can be explained well by the mass of the stars that make up the cluster.

Detection of their absorption lines has become possible with the high spatial and spectral resolution and sensitivity of the adaptive optics integral field spectrometer SPIFFI/SINFONI on the ESO VLT. Several of these OB stars appear to be helium- and nitrogen-rich. Almost all of the \~{}=80 massive stars now known in the central parsec (central arcsecond excluded) reside in one of two somewhat thick (<h/R>\~{}=0.14) rotating disks. These stellar disks have fairly sharp inner edges (R\~{}=1'') and surface density profiles that scale as R-2. We do not detect any OB stars outside the central 0.5 pc. The majority of the stars in the clockwise system appear to be on almost circular orbits, whereas most of those in the ``counterclockwise'' disk appear to be on eccentric orbits. Based on its stellar surface density distribution and dynamics, we propose that IRS 13E is an extremely dense cluster (ρcore>\~{}3×108 Msolar pc-3) that has formed in the counterclockwise disk. The stellar contents of both systems are remarkably similar, indicating a common age of \~{}=6+/-2 Myr. The K-band luminosity function of the massive stars suggests a top-heavy mass function and limits the total stellar mass contained in both disks to \~{}=1.5×104 Msolar. Our data strongly favor in situ star formation from dense gas accretion disks for the two stellar disks. This conclusion is very clear for the clockwise disk and highly plausible for the counterclockwise system.

	N2 = {The unusual transient Swift J1644+57 likely resulted from a collimated relativistic jet, powered by the sudden onset of accretion on to a massive black hole (BH) following the tidal disruption (TD) of a star. However, several mysteries cloud the interpretation of this event, including (1) the extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/γ-ray light curve during the first t - ttrig ˜10 d after the γ-ray trigger; (2) unexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission at t - ttrig ˜months; (3) lack of obvious evidence for jet precession, despite the misalignment typically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disc and BH; (4) recent abrupt shut-off in the jet X-ray emission at t - ttrig ˜1.5 yr. Here, we show that all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one assumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Φ*threading the BH. Just after the TD event, Φ*is dynamically weak relative to the high rate of fall-back accretion dot{\{}M{\}}, such that the accretion disc (jet) freely precesses about the BH axis = our line of sight. As dot{\{}M{\}} decreases, however, Φ*becomes dynamically important, leading to a state of `magnetically arrested disk' (MAD). MAD naturally aligns the jet with the BH spin, but only after an extended phase of violent rearrangement (jet wobbling), which in Swift J1644+57 starts a few days before the γ-ray trigger and explains the erratic early light curve. Indeed, the entire X-ray light curve can be fitted to the predicted power-law decay dot{\{}M{\}} ∝t\^{}{\{}-α{\}} (α≃5/3 - 2.2) if the TD occurred a few weeks prior to the γ-ray trigger. Jet energy directed away from the line of sight, either prior to the trigger or during the jet alignment process, eventually manifests as the observed radio rebrightening, similar to an off-axis (orphan) γ-ray burst afterglow. As suggested recently, the late X-ray shut-off occurs when the disc transitions to a geometrically thin (jetless) state once dot{\{}M{\}} drops below ˜the Eddington rate. We predict that, in several years, a transition to a low/hard state will mark a revival of the jet and its associated X-ray emission. We use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain the properties of the BH and disrupted star, finding that a solar mass main-sequence star disrupted by a relatively low-mass M*˜105-106 M⊙BH is consistent with the data, while a white dwarf disruption (though still possible) is disfavoured. The magnetic flux required to power Swift J1644+57 is much too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it could be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disc that was present in the galactic nucleus prior to the TD. The presence (lack of) of such a fossil disc could be a deciding factor in what TD events are accompanied by powerful jets.},

Our proper motion measurements have uncertainties of only 0.07 mas yr-1 (3 km s-1), which is gsim 7 times better than previous proper motion measurements for these stars, and enables us to measure accelerations as low as 0.2 mas yr-2 (7 km s-1 yr-1). Using these measurements, line-of-sight velocities from the literature, and three-dimensional velocities for additional young stars in the central parsec, we constrain the true orbit of each individual star and directly test the hypothesis that the massive stars reside in two stellar disks as has been previously proposed. Analysis of the stellar orbits reveals only one of the previously proposed disks of young stars using a method that is capable of detecting disks containing at least seven stars. The detected disk contains 50{\%} of the young stars, is inclined by \~{}115$\,^{\circ}$from the plane of the sky, and is oriented at a position angle of \~{}100$\,^{\circ}$east of north. Additionally, the on-disk and off-disk populations have similar K-band luminosity functions and radial distributions that decrease at larger radii as vpropr -2. The disk has an out-of-the-disk velocity dispersion of 28 $\pm$6 km s-1, which corresponds to a half-opening angle of 7$\,^{\circ}$$\pm$2$\,^{\circ}$, and several candidate disk members have eccentricities greater than 0.2. Our findings suggest that the young stars may have formed in situ but in a more complex geometry than a simple, thin circular disk.},

	N2 = {Cold fronts in cluster cool cores should be erased on short timescales by thermal conduction, unless protected by magnetic fields that are "draped" parallel to the front surfaces, suppressing conduction perpendicular to the sloshing fronts. We present a series of MHD simulations of cold front formation in the core of a galaxy cluster with anisotropic thermal conduction, exploring a parameter space of conduction strengths parallel and perpendicular to the field lines. Including conduction has a strong effect on the temperature distribution of the core and the appearance of the cold fronts. Though magnetic field lines are draping parallel to the front surfaces, preventing conduction directly across them, the temperature jumps across the fronts are nevertheless reduced. The geometry of the field is such that the cold gas below the front surfaces can be connected to hotter regions outside via field lines along directions perpendicular to the plane of the sloshing motions and along sections of the front that are not perfectly draped. This results in the heating of this gas below the front on a timescale of a Gyr, but the sharpness of the density and temperature jumps may nevertheless be preserved. By modifying the gas density distribution below the front, conduction may indirectly aid in suppressing Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. If conduction along the field lines is unsuppressed, we find that the characteristic sharp jumps seen in Chandra observations of cold front clusters do not form. Therefore, the presence of cold fronts in hot clusters is in contradiction with our simulations with full Spitzer conduction. This suggests that the presence of cold fronts in hot clusters could be used to place upper limits on conduction in the bulk of the intracluster medium. Finally, the combination of sloshing and anisotropic thermal conduction can result in a larger flux of heat to the core than either process in isolation. While still not sufficient to prevent a cooling catastrophe in the very central (r \~{} 5 kpc) regions of the cool core (where something else is required, such as active galactic nucleus feedback), it reduces significantly the mass of gas that experiences a cooling catastrophe outside those small radii.},

	N2 = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been used empirically as standardized candles to reveal the accelerating universe even though fundamental details, such as the nature of the progenitor system and how the star explodes, remained a mystery. There is consensus that a white dwarf star explodes after accreting matter in a binary system, but the secondary could be anything from a main sequence star to a red giant, or even another white dwarf. The uncertainty stems from the fact that no recent SN Ia has been discovered close enough to detect the stars before explosion. Here we report early observations of SN 2011fe (PTF11kly) in M101 at a distance of 6.4 Mpc, the closest SN Ia in the past 25 years. We find that the exploding star was likely a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, and from the lack of an early shock we conclude that the companion was most likely a main sequence star. Early spectroscopy shows high-velocity oxygen that varies on a time scale of hours and extensive mixing of newly synthesized intermediate mass elements in the outermost layers of the supernova. A companion paper uses pre-explosion images to rule out luminous red giants and most helium stars as companions.},

Using the integral-field spectrograph OSIRIS on Keck II behind the laser-guide-star adaptive optics system, this spectroscopic survey enables us to separate early-type (young, 4-6 Myr) and late-type (old, >1 Gyr) stars with a completeness of 50{\%} down to K' = 15.5 mag, which corresponds to \~{}10 M ⊙for the early-type stars. This work increases the radial extent of reported OSIRIS/Keck measurements by more than a factor of three from 4'' to 14'' (0.16 to 0.56 pc), along the projected disk of young stars. For our analysis, we implement a new method of completeness correction using a combination of star-planting simulations and Bayesian inference. We assign probabilities for the spectral type of every source detected in deep imaging down to K' = 15.5 mag using information from spectra, simulations, number counts, and the distribution of stars. The inferred radial surface-density profiles, Σ(R)vpropR -Γ, for the young stars and late-type giants are consistent with earlier results (Γearly = 0.93 $\pm$0.09, Γlate = 0.16 $\pm$0.07). The late-type surface-density profile is approximately flat out to the edge of the survey. While the late-type stellar luminosity function is consistent with the Galactic bulge, the completeness-corrected luminosity function of the early-type stars has significantly more young stars at faint magnitudes compared with previous surveys with similar depth. This luminosity function indicates that the corresponding mass function of the young stars is likely less top-heavy than that inferred from previous surveys.},

We frst show the strong inflience of the stellar dynamics on the accretion onto the central black hole. We then present more realistic simulations of Sgr A* accretion and frid that the slow winds shock and rapidly cool, forming cold gas clumps and flaments that coexist with the hot X-ray emitting gas. The accretion rate in this case is highly variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years.

We test the photoionized cloud scenario, determine the cloud properties, and estimate the emission during the pericenter passage. The incident radiation is computed starting from the individual stars at the locations of G2. The radiative transfer calculations are conducted with CLOUDY code and 2011 broadband and line luminosities are fitted. The spherically symmetric, tidally distorted, and magnetically arrested cloud shapes are tested with both the interstellar medium dust and 10 nm graphite dust. The best-fitting magnetically arrested model has the initial density n init = 1.8 ×105 cm--3, initial radius R init = 2.2 ×1015 cm = 17 mas, mass m cloud = 4 M Earth, and dust relative abundance A = 0.072. It provides a good fit to 2011 data, is consistent with the luminosities in 2004 and 2008, and reaches an agreement with the observed size. We revise down the predicted radio and X-ray bow shock luminosities to be below the quiescent level of Sgr A*, which readily leads to non-detection in agreement to observations. The magnetic energy dissipation in the cloud at the pericenter coupled with more powerful irradiation may lead to an infrared source with an apparent magnitude m{\_}{\{}L\^{}{\{}\prime {\}}{\}}\approx 13.0. No shock into the cloud and no X-rays are expected from cloud squeezing by the ambient gas pressure. Larger than previously estimated cloud mass m cloud = (4-20) M Earth may produce a higher accretion rate and a brighter state of Sgr A* as the debris descend onto the BH.},

The symmetry axes of the two sources are aligned to within 5$\,^{\circ}$in the plane of the sky, and the tips of their bow shocks point towards Sgr A*. Our measurements show that the proper motion vectors of both features are pointing in directions more than 45$\,^{\circ}$away from the line that connects them with Sgr A*. This misalignment of the bow-shock symmetry axes and their proper motion vectors, combined with the high proper motion velocities of several 100 km s-1, suggest that the bow shocks must be produced by an interaction with some external fast wind, possibly coming from Sgr A*, or from stars in its vicinity. Aims: We have developed a bow-shock model to fit the observed morphology and constrain the source of the external wind. Methods: The result of our modeling gives the best solution for bow-shock standoff distances for the two features, which allows us to estimate the velocity of the external wind, making certain that all likely stellar types of the bow-shock stars are considered. Results: We show that neither of the two bow shocks (one of which is clearly associated with a stellar source) can be produced by the influence of a stellar wind of a single mass-losing star in the central parsec. Instead, an outflow carrying a momentum comparable to the one contributed by the ensemble of the massive young stars can drive shock velocities capable of producing the observed comet-shaped features. We argue that a collimated outflow arising perpendicular to the plane of the clockwise rotating stars (CWS) can easily account for the two features and the mini-cavity. However, the collective wind from the CWS has a scale of >10''. The presence of a strong, mass-loaded outbound wind at projected distances from Sgr A* of <1''in fact agrees with models that predict a highly inefficient accretion onto the central black hole owing to a strongly radius dependent accretion flow.},

In 2002-2007 it is confused with the star S63, but free of confusion again since 2007. Its near-infrared (NIR) colors and a comparison to other sources in the field speak in favor of the DSO being an IR excess star with photospheric continuum emission at 2 microns than a core-less gas and dust cloud. We also find very compact L'-band emission ({\$}<{\$}0.1'') contrasted by the reported extended (0.03'' up to about 0.2'' for the tail) Brgamma emission. The presence of a star will change the expected accretion phenomena, since a stellar Roche lobe may retain a fraction of the material during and after the peri-bothron passage.},

	N2 = {The presence of a 2.9+/-0.4 million solar mass object in the central stellar cluster of the Milky Way has recently been demonstrated via measurements of the stellar proper motions and radial velocities. This mass is located at the position of the compact radio source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) at a distance of Ro=8.0 kpc and is most likely present in the form of a massive black hole (BH). Some of the stars have a projected distance to Sgr A* of <=0.005 pc and have proper motion velocities of up to 1400 km s-1. Recent measurements indicate that their orbits show significant curvatures indicating that the stars indeed orbit the central compact object. Detailed measurements of the stellar orbits close to Sgr A* will allow us to precisely determine the distribution of this mass. With an increased point source sensitivity due to the combination of large telescope apertures, adaptive optics, and - in the very near future - NIR interferometry it is likely that stars with orbital time scales of the order of one year will be detected. Theses sources, however, will most likely not be on simple Keplerian orbits. The effects of measurable prograde relativistic and retrograde Newtonian periastron shifts will result in rosetta shaped orbits. A substantial Newtonian periastron rotation can already be expected if only a few percent of the central mass are extended. We discuss the conditions under which an extended mass can (over-) compensate the relativistic periastron shift. We also demonstrate that measuring a single periastron shift is not sufficient to determine the distribution of an extended mass component. A periastron shift will allow us to determine the inclination of the stellar orbits and to derive inclination corrected shift values. These have to be acquired for three stars on orbits with different energy or angular momentum in order to unambiguously solve for the compactness, extent and shape of any extended mass contribution.},

Exploring this population will have important consequences for the observation prospects of gravitational waves as well as understanding galactic evolution. The gas cloud G2 currently approaching Sgr A* provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe the black hole and neutron star population of the Galactic nucleus. We examine the possibility of a G2-cloud-black-hole encounter and its detectability with current x-ray satellites, such as Chandra and NuSTAR. We find that multiple encounters are likely to occur close to the pericenter, which may be detectable upon favorable circumstances. This opportunity provides an additional important science case for leading x-ray observatories to closely follow G2 on its way to the nucleus.},

Recent observations have shown that the cluster has a shallower surface density profile than expected for a dynamically relaxed cusp, leading to important implications for its formation and evolution. However, the true 3D profile of the cluster is unknown due to the difficulty in de-projecting the stellar number counts. Here, we use spherical Jeans modeling of individual proper motions and radial velocities to constrain, for the first time, the de-projected spatial density profile, cluster velocity anisotropy, black hole mass (M BH), and distance to the Galactic center (R 0) simultaneously. We find that the inner stellar density profile of the late-type stars, ρ(r)vpropr --γ, have a power law slope \gamma =0.05{\_}{\{}-0.60{\}}\^{}{\{}+0.29{\}}, much more shallow than the frequently assumed Bahcall-Wolf slope of γ= 7/4. The measured slope will significantly affect dynamical predictions involving the cluster, such as the dynamical friction time scale. The cluster core must be larger than 0.5 pc, which disfavors some scenarios for its origin. Our measurement of M{\_}{\{}BH{\}}=5.76{\_}{\{}-1.26{\}}\^{}{\{}+1.76{\}}\times 10\^{}6 M \&{\#}9737; and R{\_}0=8.92{\_}{\{}-0.55{\}}\^{}{\{}+0.58{\}} kpc is consistent with that derived from stellar orbits within 1'' of Sgr A*. When combined with the orbit of S0-2, the uncertainty on R 0 is reduced by 30{\%} (8.46{\_}{\{}-0.38{\}}\^{}{\{}+0.42{\}}\ kpc). We suggest that the MW NSC can be used in the future in combination with stellar orbits to significantly improve constraints on R 0.},

One complicating factor is the presence of perturbations from other stars, which may induce orbital precession of the same order of magnitude as that due to general relativistic effects. The expected number of stars in this region is small enough that full N-body simulations can be carried out. We present the results of a comprehensive set of such simulations, which include a post-Newtonian treatment of spin-orbit effects. A number of possible models for the distribution of stars and stellar remnants are considered. We find that stellar perturbations are likely to obscure the signal due to frame dragging for stars beyond ˜0.5mpc from the black hole, while measurement of the quadrupole moment is likely to require observation of stars inside ˜0.2mpc. A high fraction of stellar remnants, e.g. 10M⊙black holes, in this region would make tests of general relativity problematic at all radii. We discuss the possibility of separating the effects of stellar perturbations from those due to general relativity.},

To this end, we have measured the equivalent widths of the D lines for a sample of 39 dwarf and 45 giant late-type stars observed with high spectral resolution. We constructed photospheric models over a grid in effective temperature and surface gravity spanning the spectral types F to M, and luminosity classes V and III of the sample stars. The model photospheres were extended into the chromosphere by assuming a suitable scaling from the Sun, and theoretical Nai D equivalent widths were computed over the grid of models including the deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium. By taking into account both the experimental errors and the possible variations of stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, sodium abundance and microturbulence), the comparison between observed and computed equivalent widths allows us to state that the model atmospheres we have used can reproduce the observations for the two luminosity classes and for all the spectral types except for the M-type stars. We have discussed the importance of line blanketing in the spectral analysis of these stars, but at present we cannot conclude that this effect would reduce the discrepancy.},

When integrating whole spectral energy distributions, bolometric corrections are widely used. These corrections are typically specified for a well defined object type, a measured photometric colour, and the colour index range for which it is calibrated. Aims: We provide this bolometric correction for the near-infrared colours of red late giants. Methods: We compare bolometric luminosities derived from fits to spectral energy distributions covering the visual and near, mid, and far infrared to different near-infrared colour indices to define subgroups within our stellar sample and finally obtain specific bolometric corrections. Results: For well-defined subgroups of different near-infrared colours and atmospheric chemistry, we present four distinct bolometric colour relations and compare these to earlier results from the literature.},

	N2 = {In this paper, we present a model for the long-term evolution of the merger of two unequal mass C/O white dwarfs (WDs). After the dynamical phase of the merger, magnetic stresses rapidly redistribute angular momentum, leading to nearly solid body rotation on a viscous timescale, 1e4-1e8 s, long before significant cooling can occur. Because of heating during the dynamical and viscous phases, the less massive WD is transformed into a hot radially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure and with the majority of the mass having negligible rotational support. This extended envelope then undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction on a thermal timescale of \~{}1e4 yr; during this period, the merger remnant radiates near the Eddington limit. Given the double WD merger rate of a few per 1000 yr, a few dozen of these near-Eddington sources should exist in a Milky Way-type galaxy. In our calculations, the contraction of the cooling envelope is relatively rapid, and the base of the envelope is compressed until off-center convective C-burning begins. As a result, the long-term evolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previous calculations, and a collapse to a neutron star, rather than a Type Ia supernova, is the likely outcome. However, the physical picture and the dynamical state of the matter in our model differ from previous work. Furthermore, substantial remaining uncertainties related to the opacity of the envelope and mass loss during the thermal evolution may significantly affect our conclusions. Thus, future work within the context of the physical model presented here is required to better address the potential of WD mergers as Type Ia supernova progenitors.},

	N2 = {Active galactic nuclei, which are powered by long-term accretion onto central supermassive black holes, produce relativistic jets with lifetimes of at least one million years, and the observation of the birth of such a jet is therefore unlikely. Transient accretion onto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption of a stray star, thus offers a rare opportunity to study the birth of a relativistic jet. On 25 March 2011, an unusual transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) was found, potentially representing such an accretion event. Here we report observations spanning centimetre to millimetre wavelengths and covering the first month of evolution of a luminous radio transient associated with Swift J164449.3+573451. The radio transient coincides with the nucleus of an inactive galaxy. We conclude that we are seeing a newly formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto a million-solar-mass black hole. A relativistic outflow is not predicted in this situation, but we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturally explains the observed high-energy properties and radio luminosity and the inferred rate of such events. The weaker beaming in the radio-frequency spectrum relative to γ-rays or X-rays suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z\~{}6.},

	N2 = {Using archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multi-epoch imaging data (Stripe 82), we have searched for the tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes in non-active galaxies. Two candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) are identified. The TDE flares have optical blackbody temperatures of 2 ×104 K and observed peak luminosities of Mg = -18.3 and -20.4 (νL ν= 5 ×1042, 4 ×1043 erg s-1, in the rest frame); their cooling rates are very low, qualitatively consistent with expectations for tidal disruption flares. The properties of the TDE candidates are examined using (1) SDSS imaging to compare them to other flares observed in the search, (2) UV emission measured by GALEX, and (3) spectra of the hosts and of one of the flares. Our pipeline excludes optically identifiable AGN hosts, and our variability monitoring over nine years provides strong evidence that these are not flares in hidden AGNs. The spectra and color evolution of the flares are unlike any SN observed to date, their strong late-time UV emission is particularly distinctive, and they are nuclear at high resolution arguing against these being first cases of a previously unobserved class of SNe or more extreme examples of known SN types. Taken together, the observed properties are difficult to reconcile with an SN or an AGN-flare explanation, although an entirely new process specific to the inner few hundred parsecs of non-active galaxies cannot be excluded. Based on our observed rate, we infer that hundreds or thousands of TDEs will be present in current and next-generation optical synoptic surveys. Using the approach outlined here, a TDE candidate sample with O(1) purity can be selected using geometric resolution and host and flare color alone, demonstrating that a campaign to create a large sample of TDEs, with immediate and detailed multi-wavelength follow-up, is feasible. A by-product of this work is quantification of the power spectrum of extreme flares in AGNs.},

The extreme variability (a factor of nearly 50), luminosity (>2 ×1042 erg s-1), long duration (>5 yr) and supersoft X-ray spectrum (<0.1 keV) are characteristic signatures of a stellar tidal disruption event according to theoretical predictions and to existing X-ray observations, implying a massive ≳105 M⊙black hole at the centre of that galaxy. The large number of X-ray source counts (˜700) and long temporal baseline (˜12 yr with Chandra and XMM-Newton) make this one of the best sampled examples of any tidal flare candidate to date. The transient may be the same EUV source originally found contaminating the diffuse intracluster medium observations of Bowyer, Bergh{\"o}fer and Korpela, which would make it the only tidal flare candidate with reported EUV observations and implies an early source luminosity 1-2 orders of magnitude greater. If the host galaxy is a cluster member then it must be a dwarf galaxy, an order of magnitude less massive than the quiescent galaxy Henize 2-10 which hosts a massive black hole that is difficult to reconcile with its low mass. The unusual faintness of the host galaxy may be explained by tidal stripping in the cluster core.},

From the conservative assumption that this value exceeds the Eddington limit by at most a factor of 10, the minimum mass is then 500 M{\_}⊙. The X-ray luminosity varies by a factor of 40 with an apparent recurrence timescale of approximately one year. This X-ray variability is associated with spectral state transitions similar to those seen in black hole X-ray binaries. Here we discuss our recent modelling of all the X-ray data for HLX-1 and show that it supports the idea that this ULX is powered by sub- and near Eddington accretion onto an intermediate mass black hole. We also present evidence for transient radio emission which is consistent with a discrete jet ejection event as well as comment on the nature of the environment around HLX-1 in light of recent Hubble Space Telescope photometry.},

	N2 = {A unique feature of deflagration-to-detonation (DDT) white dwarf explosion models of SNe of type Ia is the presence of a strong shock wave propagating through the outer envelope. We consider the early emission expected in such models, which is produced by the expanding shock-heated outer part of the ejecta and precedes the emission driven by radioactive decay. We expand on earlier analyses by considering the modification of the pre-detonation density profile by the weak-shocks generated during the deflagration phase, the time evolution of the opacity, and the deviation of the post-shock equation of state from that obtained for radiation pressure domination. A simple analytic model is presented and shown to provide an acceptable approximation to the results of 1D numerical DDT simulations. Our analysis predicts a thousand second long UV/optical flash with a luminosity of \~{}1 to 3*1e39 erg/s. Lower luminosity corresponds to faster (turbulent) deflagration velocity. The predicted luminosity of the UV flash is an order of magnitude lower than that of earlier estimates, and is expected to be strongly suppressed at times longer than an hour due to the deviation from pure radiation domination.},

The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

	N2 = {The highly unusual pair of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB060218 and an associated supernova, SN2006aj, has puzzled theorists for years. A supernova shock breakout and a jet from a newborn stellar mass compact object have been proposed to explain this pair's multiwavelength signature. Alternatively, we propose that the source is naturally explained by another channel: the tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). This tidal disruption is accompanied by a tidal pinching, which leads to the ignition of a WD and a supernova. Some debris falls back onto the IMBH, forms a disk, which quickly amplifies the magnetic field, and launches a jet. We successfully fit soft X-ray spectra with the Comptonized blackbody emission from a jet photosphere. The optical/UV emission is consistent with self-absorbed synchrotron emission from the expanding jet front. The temporal dependence of the accretion rate \dot{\{}M{\}}(t) in a tidal disruption provides a good fit to the soft X-ray light curve. The IMBH mass is found to be about 104 M ⊙in three independent estimates: (1) fitting the tidal disruption \dot{\{}M{\}}(t) to the soft X-ray light curve, (2) computing the jet base radius in a jet photospheric emission model, and (3) inferring the mass of the central black hole based on the host dwarf galaxy's stellar mass. The position of the supernova is consistent with the center of the host galaxy, while the low supernova ejecta mass is consistent with that of a WD. The high expected rate of tidal disruptions in dwarf galaxies is consistent with one source observed by the Swift satellite over several years at a distance of 150 Mpc measured for GRB060218. Encounters with WDs provide much fuel for the growth of IMBHs.},

	N2 = {A new general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamical code KORAL, is described, which employs the M1 scheme to close the radiation moment equations. The code has been successfully verified against a number of tests. Axisymmetric simulations of super-critical magnetized accretion on a non-rotating black hole (a=0.0) and a spinning black hole (a=0.9) are presented. The accretion rates in the two models are \dot M = 100-200 \dot M{\_}Edd. These first general relativistic simulations of super-critical black hole accretion are potentially relevant to tidal disruption events and hyper-accreting supermassive black holes in the early universe. Both simulated models are optically and geometrically thick, and have funnels through which energy escapes in the form of relativistic gas, Poynting flux and radiative flux. The jet is significantly more powerful in the a=0.9 run. The net energy outflow rate in the two runs correspond to efficiencies of 5{\%} (a=0) and 33{\%} (a=0.9), as measured with respect to the mass accretion rate at the black hole. These efficiencies agree well with those measured in previous simulations of non-radiative geometrically thick disks. Furthermore, in the a=0.9 run, the outflow power appears to originate in the spinning black hole, suggesting that the associated physics is again similar in non-radiative and super-critical accretion flows. While the two simulations are efficient in terms of total energy outflow, both runs are radiatively inefficient. Their luminosities are only \sim 1-10 L{\_}Edd, which corresponds to a radiative efficiency \sim 0.1{\%}. Interestingly, most of the radiative luminosity emerges through the funnels, which subtend a very small solid angle. Therefore, measured in terms of a local radiative flux, the emitted radiation is highly super-Eddington.},

The galaxies, which are non-active as evidenced by the narrow line ratios, show broad emission lines of complex profiles in more than half of the sample. Both the high-ionization coronal lines and the broad lines are fading on timescales of years in objects observed with spectroscopic follow-ups, suggesting their transient nature. Variations of inferred non-stellar continua, which have absolute magnitudes of at least -16 to -18 mag in the g band, are also detected in more than half of the sample. The coronal line emitters reside in sub-L * disk galaxies (-21.3 < Mi < -18.5) with small stellar velocity dispersions. The sample seems to form two distinct types based on the presence or absence of the {$[$}Fe VII{$]$} lines, with the latter having relatively low luminosities of {$[$}O III{$]$}, {$[$}Fe XI{$]$}, and the host galaxies. These characteristics can most naturally be understood in the context of transient accretion onto intermediate-mass black holes at galactic centers following tidal disruption of stars in a gas-rich environment. We estimate the incidence of such events to be around 10-5 yr-1 for a galaxy with -21.3 < Mi < -18.5.},

SDSS J0952+2143 is unique in its strong multiwavelength variability; such a broadband emission-line and continuum response has not been observed before. The strong iron line emission is accompanied by unusual Balmer line emission with a broad base, narrow core, and double-peaked narrow horns, and strong He II emission. These lines, while strong in the SDSS spectrum taken in 2005, have faded away significantly in new spectra taken in 2007 December. Comparison of SDSS, 2MASS, GALEX, and follow-up GROND photometry reveals variability in the NUV, optical, and NIR band. Taken together, these unusual observations can be explained by a giant outburst in the EUV-X-ray band, detected even in the optical and NIR. The intense and variable iron, helium, and Balmer lines represent the ``light echo'' of the flare, as it traveled through circumnuclear material. The outburst may have been caused by the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. Spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS are well suited to detect emission-line light echoes of such rare flare events. Reverberation-mapping of these light echoes can then be used as a new and efficient probe of the physical conditions in the circumnuclear material in nonactive or active galaxies.},

The ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) 0.1-2.5 keV X-ray spectrum, obtained simultaneously with the WFC survey, appears extremely steep. Subsequent deeper pointed observations with ROSAT revealed that its 0.1-2.5 keV count rate had decreased by an extremely large amount (a factor of \~{}70). This is comparable to the variability amplitude seen in another ultrasoft Seyfert, E1615+061. There appears to be \~{}10 times as much flux in the soft component as in any expected hard tail, suggesting that, in the absence of partial covering of the hard flux, the soft flux cannot arise via reprocessing of the hard tail. Zwicky 159.034's peculiar optical spectrum has permitted lines with widths \~{}1200-1500 km s\^{}-1, and forbidden lines are weak or absent. Its optical spectrum shows evidence for variability, and might be used to study the role that reprocessed X-rays play in the formation of optical lines.},

In these events, the star develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. After completing an eccentric orbit, the bound debris falls into the black hole, forming an accretion disk and emitting radiation. The same process may occur on planetary scales if a minor body passes too close to its star. In the Solar System, comets fall directly into our Sun or onto planets. If the star is a compact object, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. Indeed, one of the first mechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion of comets onto neutron stars in our Galaxy. Here we report that the peculiarities of the `Christmas' gamma-ray burst (GRB 101225A) can be explained by a tidal disruption event of a minor body around an isolated Galactic neutron star. This would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compact stellar remnants more frequently than occurs in the Solar System or that minor-body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. A peculiar supernova associated with a gamma-ray burst provides an alternative explanation.},

Unlike our previous work, here we use state-of-the-art observational data on orbits and wind properties of individual wind-producing stars. Since wind velocities were revised upwards and non-zero eccentricities were considered, our new simulations show fewer clumps of cold gas and no conspicuous disc-like structure. The accretion rate is dominated by a few close `slow-wind stars' (vw <= 750kms-1), and is consistent with the Bondi estimate, but variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. This variability is due to the stochastic infall of cold clumps of gas, as in earlier simulations, and to the eccentric orbits of stars. The present models fail to explain the high luminosity of Sgr A* a few hundred years ago implied by Integral observations, but we argue that the accretion of a cold clump with a small impact parameter could have caused it. Finally, we show the possibility of constraining the total mass-loss rate of the `slow-wind stars' using near infrared observations of gas in the central few arcseconds.},

During 2013, the laser guide star adaptive optics systems on the W. M. Keck I and II telescopes were used to obtain three epochs of spectroscopy and imaging at the highest spatial resolution currently possible in the near-IR. The updated orbital solution derived from radial velocities in addition to Br-Gamma line astrometry is consistent with our earlier estimates. Strikingly, even \~{}6 months before pericenter passage there is no perceptible deviation from a Keplerian orbit. We furthermore show that a proposed "tail" of G2 is likely not associated with it but is rather an independent gas structure. We also show that G2 does not seem to be unique, since several red emission-line objects can be found in the central arcsecond. Taken together, it seems more likely that G2 is ultimately stellar in nature, although there is clearly gas associated with it.},

To understand what happened we observed this event in the X-ray band on several occasions. Methods: Follow-up observations with XMM-Newton, Swift, and MAXI are presented together with the INTEGRAL data. Long and short term variability are analysed and the event wide band spectral shape modelled. Results: The spectrum of the source can be described with an absorbed (NH \~{} 7 ×1022 cm-2) power law (Γ≃2.2), characteristic of an accreting source, plus a soft X-ray excess, likely to be of diffuse nature. The hard X-ray flux increased to maximum in a few weeks and decreased over a year, with the evolution expected for a tidal disruption event. The fast variations observed near the flare maximum allowed us to estimate the mass of the central black hole in NGC 4845 as \~{}3 ×105 M⊙. The observed flare corresponds to the disruption of about 10{\%} of an object with a mass of 14-30 Jupiter. The hard X-ray emission should come from a corona forming around the accretion flow close to the black hole. This is the first tidal event where such a corona has been observed.},

	N2 = {One of the challenges to increasing the mass of a white dwarf through accretion is the tendency for the accumulating hydrogen to ignite unstably and potentially trigger mass loss. It has been known for many years that there is a narrow range of accretion rates for which the hydrogen can burn stably, allowing for the white dwarf mass to increase as a pure helium layer accumulates. We first review the physics of stable burning, providing a clear explanation for why radiation pressure stabilization leads to a narrow range of accretion rates for stable burning near the Eddington limit, confirming the recent work of Nomoto and collaborators. We also explore the possibility of stabilization due to a high luminosity from beneath the burning layer. We then examine the impact of the β-decay-limited ``hot'' CNO cycle on the stability of burning. Although this plays a significant role for accreting neutron stars, we find that for accreting white dwarfs, it can only increase the range of stably burning accretion rates for metallicities <0.01 Zsolar.},

	N2 = {Classical nova outbursts are thermonuclear stellar explosions driven by charged-particle reactions. Extensive numerical simulations of nova explosions have shown that the accreted envelopes attain peak temperatures ranging between 0.1 and 0.4 GK, for about several hundred seconds, and therefore, their ejecta is expected to show signatures of nuclear processing. Indeed, it has been claimed that novae play some role in the enrichment of the interstellar medium in a number of intermediate-mass elements. This includes \^{}{\{}17{\}}O, \^{}{\{}15{\}}N, and \^{}{\{}13{\}}C, significantly overproduced with respect to solar abundances, and a lower contribution to a number of species with A<40, such as \^{}{\{}7{\}}Li, \^{}{\{}19{\}}F, or \^{}{\{}26{\}}Al. In this paper, we review the modeling of classical nova outbursts, from spherically-symmetric (1D) hydrodynamic models to recent multidimensional simulations. The predicted nucleosynthesis accompanying nova outbursts is briefly compared with the abundances determined in meteoritic presolar grains of putative nova origin. The impact of current nuclear uncertainties on the final yields is also outlined.},

Then, the evolution of components of initial mass 10.5, 11, and 12 solar masses is examined, and the conditions necessary for the formation of ONe degenerate dwarfs are studied. The evolution of models of three and four solar masses that experience only one phase of Roche-lobe overflow and become degenerate dwarfs containing substantial amounts of helium is explored. A mapping that relates the mass and composition of a degenerate remnant to the mass and status of its progenitor is provided. The responses to accretion of a Roche-lobe-filling component and of a cold CO degenerate dwarf are examined. Extensive comparisons with other types of stars are made.},

IUE spectra were obtained once every 2 days for a period of 74 days beginning on 1993 March 14. During the last 39 days of this campaign, spectroscopic observations were also made with the HST Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) on a daily basis. Ground-based observations, consisting of 165 optical spectra and 77 photometric observations (both CCD imaging and aperture photometry), are reported for the period 1992 October-1993 September, although many of the data are concentrated around the time of the satellite-based program. These data constitute a fifth year of intensive optical monitoring of this galaxy. In this contribution we describe the acquisition and reduction of all of the satellite and ground-based data obtained in this program. We describe in detail various photometric problems with the FOS and explain how we identified and corrected for various anomalies.},

	N2 = {We review past work using broad emission lines as virial estimators of black hole masses in quasars. Basically one requires estimates of the emitting region radius and virial velocity dispersion to obtain black hole masses. The three major ways to estimate the broad-line emitting region (BLR) radius involve: (1) direct reverberation mapping, (2) derivation of BLR radius for larger samples using the radius-luminosity correlation derived from reverberation measures, and (3) estimates of BLR radius using the definition of the ionization parameter solved for BLR radius (photoionization method). At low redshift (z ≲0.7) FWHM Hβserves as the most widely used estimator of virial velocity dispersion. FWHM Hβcan provide estimates for tens of thousands of quasars out to z ≈3.8 (IR spectroscopy beyond z ≈1). A new photoionization method also shows promise for providing many reasonable estimates of BLR radius via high S/N IR spectroscopy of the UV region 1300-2000 {\AA}. FWHM MgIIλ2800 can serve as a surrogate for FWHM Hβin the range 0.4 ≲z ≲6.5 while CIVλ1549 is affected by broadening due to non-virial motions and best avoided (i.e. there is no clear conversion factor between FWHM Hβand FWHM CIVλ1549). Most quasars yield mass estimates in the range 7 ≲log MBH ≲9.7. There is no strong evidence for values above 10.0 and there may be evidence for a turnover in the maximum black hole mass near z ≈5.},

These improvements are made possible by refining our astrometric reference frame with a new geometric optical distortion model for the W. M. Keck II 10 m telescope's adaptive optics camera (NIRC2) in its narrow field mode. For the first time, this distortion model is constructed from on-sky measurements and is made available to the public in the form of FITS files. When applied to widely dithered images, it produces residuals in the separations of stars that are a factor of \~{}3 smaller compared with the outcome using previous models. By applying this new model, along with corrections for differential atmospheric refraction, to widely dithered images of SiO masers at the Galactic center (GC), we improve our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio Sgr A*-rest frame. The resulting infrared reference frame is \~{}2-3 times more accurate and stable than earlier published efforts. In this reference frame, Sgr A* is localized to within a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas yr-1, or \~{}3.4 km s-1 at 8 kpc (1σ). Also, proper motions for members of the central stellar cluster are more accurate, although less precise, due to the limited number of these wide field measurements. These proper motion measurements show that, with respect to Sgr A*, the central stellar cluster has no rotation in the plane of the sky to within 0.3 mas yr-1 arcsec-1, has no net translational motion with respect to Sgr A* to within 0.1 mas yr-1, and has net rotation perpendicular to the plane of the sky along the Galactic plane, as has previously been observed. While earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame by assuming no net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentally limited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not improve with time. We define a reference frame with SiO masers and this reference frame's stability should improve steadily with future measurements of the SiO masers in this region (vpropt -3/2). This is essential for achieving the necessary reference frame stability required to detect the effects of general relativity and extended mass on short-period stars at the GC.},

The structure of entire stars is computed using an implicit hydrodynamics computer code, and careful consideration is given to the complex nuclear processes that characterize the final evolutionary stages. The configurations of the stars at the begining of core collapse are presented, salient features of the presupernova models are examined, and implications for nucleosynthesis and the supernova explosions believed to follow are discussed. It is found that both stars form substantially neutronized 'iron' cores during hydrostatic silicon burning and that the element abundances in the larger star have ratios that are remarkably close to their solar system values over the mass range from oxygen to calcium, while the smaller star is characterized by large enhancements of Ne, Mg, and Si.},

We infer a relatively narrow range for the initial masses of the progenitor system: M 10 = 2.3 $\pm$0.2 M sun and M 20 = 1.7 $\pm$0.2 M sun, where M 10 and M 20 are the initial masses of the progenitors of the white dwarf and Regulus, respectively. In this scenario, the age of the Regulus system would exceed 1 Gyr. We also show that Regulus, with a current orbital period of 40 days, has an interesting future ahead of it. This includes (1) a common envelope phase, and, quite possibly, (2) an sdB phase, followed by (3) an AM CVn phase with orbital periods lsim1 hr. Binary evolution calculations are presented in support of this scenario. We also discuss alternative possibilities, emphasizing the present uncertainties in binary evolution theory. Thus, this one particular star system illustrates many different aspects of binary stellar evolution.},

For realistic initial conditions taken from pre-supernova (pre-SN) evolution calculations, the densities and temperatures involved require the use of a detailed equation of state and neutrino cooling processes, as well as a qualitative consideration of the effects of general relativity. Through two-dimensional dynamical calculations we show how the energy release is affected by the rotation rate and the strength of angular momentum transport, giving rise to qualitatively different solutions in limits of high and low angular momentum, each being capable of powering a gamma-ray burst (GRB). We explore the likelihood of producing Fe-group elements in the two regimes and suggest that while large and massive centrifugally supported disks are capable of driving strong outflows with a possible SN-like signature, quasi-radial flows lack such a feature and may produce a GRB without such an accompanying feature, as seen in GRB060505.},

	N2 = {The association of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with Type Ic supernovae presents a challenge to supernova explosion models. In the collapsar model for LGRBs, gamma rays are produced in an ultrarelativistic jet launching from the magnetosphere of the black hole that forms in the aftermath of the collapse of a rotating progenitor star. The jet is collimated along the star's rotation axis, but the concomitant luminous supernova should be relatively---though certainly not entirely---spherical, and should synthesize a substantial mass of 56Ni. Our goal is to provide a qualitative assessment of the possibility that accretion of the progenitor envelope onto the black hole, which powers the LGRB, could also deposit sufficient energy and nickel mass in the envelope to produce a luminous supernova. For this, the energy dissipated near the black hole during accretion must be transported outward, where it can drive a supernova-like shock wave. Here we suggest that the energy is transported by convection and develop an analytical toy model, relying on global mass and energy conservation, for the dynamics of stellar collapse. The model suggests that a \~{}10 000 km s-1 shock can be driven into the envelope and that \~{}1051 erg explosions are possible. The efficiency with which the accretion energy is being transferred to the envelope is governed by the competition of advection and convection at distances \~{}100-1000 km from the black hole and is sensitive to the values of the convective mixing length, the magnitude of the effective viscous stress, and the specific angular momentum of the infalling envelope. Substantial masses of 56Ni may be synthesized in the convective accretion flow over the course of tens of seconds from the initial circularization of the infalling envelope around the black hole. The synthesized nickel is convectively mixed with a much larger mass of unburned ejecta.},

	N2 = {We consider the long-term evolution of debris following the tidal disruption of compact stars in the context of short gamma ray bursts. The initial encounter impulsively creates a hot, dense, neutrino-cooled disk capable of powering the prompt emission. After a long delay, we find that powerful winds are launched from the surface of the disk, driven by the recombination of free nucleons into α-particles. The associated energy release depletes the mass supply and eventually shuts off activity of the central engine. As a result, the luminosity and mass accretion rate deviate from the earlier self-similar behavior expected for an isolated ring with efficient cooling. This then enables a secondary episode of delayed activity to become prominent as an observable signature, when material in the tidal tails produced by the initial encounter returns to the vicinity of the central object. The timescale of the new accretion event can reach tens of seconds to minutes, depending on the details of the system. The associated energies and timescales are consistent with those occurring in X-ray flares.},

As the star plunges to smaller radius at 1000-6000 km s-1, a strong bow shock forms where the stellar wind is impacted by the hot X-ray emitting gas in the vicinity of SgrA*. For a stellar mass-loss rate of 4 ×10-8 M ⊙yr-1 and wind velocity 100 km s-1, the bow shock will have an emission measure (EM = n 2 vol) at a distance \~{}1016 cm, similar to that inferred from the IR emission lines. The ionization of the dense bow shock gas is potentially provided by collisional ionization at the shock front and cooling radiation (X-ray and UV) from the post shock gas. The former would predict a constant line flux as a function of distance from SgrA*, while the latter will have increasing emission at lesser distances. In this model, the star and its mass-loss wind should survive pericenter passage since the wind is likely launched at 0.2 AU and this is much less than the Roche radius at pericenter (\~{}3 AU for a stellar mass of 2 M ⊙). In this model, the emission cloud will probably survive pericenter passage, discriminating this scenario from others.},

	N2 = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded from the project Web site (http://mesa.sourceforge.net/).},

Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M ⊙stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA star results.},

Our preliminary results in 2013 show that Sgr A* on mas scales has been in ordinary state as of August 2013, although some fraction of the G2 cloud already passed pericenter of Sgr A* in April 2013.

S0-102 doubles the number of known stars with full phase coverage and periods of less than 20 years.

	N2 = {Type Ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars composed of carbon and oxygen, were instrumental as distance indicators in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. However, the physics of the explosion are debated. Here we report a systematic spectral analysis of a large sample of well-observed type Ia supernovae. Mapping the velocity distribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoretical scenarios. We find that all supernovae have low-velocity cores of stable iron-group elements. Outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernova ejecta. The outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount of nickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal product of incomplete burning. The outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar in all supernovae, having an expansion velocity of \~{}11,000 kilometers per second and corresponding to a mass of slightly over one solar mass. This indicates that all the supernovae considered here burned similar masses and suggests that their progenitors had the same mass. Synthetic light-curve parameters and three-dimensional explosion simulations support this interpretation. A single explosion scenario, possibly a delayed detonation, may thus explain most type Ia supernovae.},

In this paper, we find the minimum helium layer thickness that will sustain a steady laterally propagating detonation and show that it depends on the density and composition of the helium layer, specifically 12C and 16O. Detonations in these thin helium layers have speeds slower than the Chapman-Jouget (CJ) speed from complete helium burning, v CJ = 1.5 ×109 cm s-1. Though gravitationally unbound, the ashes still have unburned helium (≈80{\%} in the thinnest cases) and only reach up to heavy elements such as 40Ca, 44Ti, 48Cr, and 52Fe. It is rare for these thin shells to generate large amounts of 56Ni. We also find a new set of solutions that can propagate in even thinner helium layers when 16O is present at a minimum mass fraction of ≈0.07. Driven by energy release from αcaptures on 16O and subsequent elements, these slow detonations only create ashes up to 28Si in the outer detonated He shell. We close by discussing how the unbound helium burning ashes may create faint and fast "Ia" supernovae as well as events with virtually no radioactivity, and speculate on how the slower helium detonation velocities impact the off-center ignition of a carbon detonation that could cause a Type Ia supernova in the double detonation scenario.},

We also examine recurrent novae that are accreting at rates close to, but below, the stable burning limit and report their recurrence times. Our dense grid in accretion rates finds the expected minimum possible recurrence times as a function of the WD mass. This enables inferences to be made about the minimum WD mass possible to reach a specific recurrence time. We compare our computational models of post-outburst novae to the stably burning WDs and explicitly calculate the duration and effective temperature (T eff) of the post-nova WD in the supersoft phase. We agree with the measured turnoff time-T eff relation in M31 by Henze and collaborators, infer WD masses in the 1.0-1.3 M \&{\#}9737; range, and predict ejection masses consistent with those observed.

We find that star clusters with initial half-mass relaxation times <\~{}25 Myr are dominated by stellar collisions, the first collisions occurring at or near the point of core collapse, which is driven by the segregation of the most massive stars to the cluster center, where they end up in hard binaries. The majority of collisions occur with the same star, resulting in the runaway growth of a supermassive object. This object can grow up to \~{}0.1{\%} of the mass of the entire star cluster and could manifest itself as an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). The phase of runaway growth lasts until mass loss by stellar evolution arrests core collapse.

	N2 = {In recent numerical simulations, it has been found that the eccentricity of supermassive black hole (SMBH)-intermediate black hole (IMBH) binaries grows toward unity through interactions with the stellar background. This increase of eccentricity reduces the merging timescale of the binary through the gravitational radiation to a value well below the Hubble time. It also gives a theoretical explanation of the existence of eccentric binaries such as that in OJ287. In self-consistent N-body simulations, this increase of eccentricity is always observed. On the other hand, the result of the scattering experiment between SMBH binaries and field stars indicated that the eccentricity dose not change significantly. This discrepancy leaves the high eccentricity of the SMBH binaries in N-body simulations unexplained. Here, we present a stellar-dynamical mechanism that drives the increase of the eccentricity of an SMBH binary with a large mass ratio. There are two key processes involved. The first one is the Kozai mechanism under a non-axisymmetric potential, which effectively randomizes the angular momenta of surrounding stars. The other is the selective ejection of stars with prograde orbits. Through these two mechanisms, field stars extract the orbital angular momentum of the SMBH binary. Our proposed mechanism causes the increase in the eccentricity of most of SMBH binaries, resulting in the rapid merger through gravitational wave radiation. Our result has given a definite solution to the "last-parsec problem."},

From these, the loss of energy and angular momentum of a system due to the radiation of gravitational waves is found. Two techniques, radiation reaction and flux across a large sphere, are used in these calculations and are shown to be in agreement over a time average. In the nonrelativistic limit, the energy and angular momentum radiation and angular distributions are expressed in terms of time derivatives of the quadrupole tensor Qij. These results are then applied to a bound system of two point masses moving in elliptical orbits. The secular decays of the semimajor axis and eccentricity are found as functions of time, and are integrated to specify the decay by gravitational radiation of such systems as functions of their initial conditions.},

Certain astronomical questions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies, require transforming these inherently redshift-dependent magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. To prepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail in subsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to broadband photometric observations in the context of the optical observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Linear combinations of four spectral templates can reproduce the five SDSS magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of the photometry. Expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of the coefficients multiplying the templates is planar and, in fact, nearly linear. The resulting reconstructed SEDs can be used to recover fixed-frame magnitudes over a range of redshifts. This process yields consistent results in the sense that, within each sample, the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies are nearly constant with redshift. We compare our results with simpler interpolation methods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the SDSS. The software that generates these results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide range of galaxy observations. Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

Due to their large radii and the low binding energy of the stellar envelope, giants are vulnerable to envelope stripping from collisions with the accretion disk. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such collisions will typically deposit a substantial fraction of the envelope mass into the disk on each passage. Repeated encounters will then lead to the complete destruction of the star save for the dense core. We estimate the rate of fuel supply by this mechanism using simple models for the AGN disk and central stellar cluster. If the central stellar density is \~{}10\^{}7\^{} M{\_}sun{\_} pc\^{}-3\^{}, then stripping of giants could account for the activity of typical AGNs provided that the accretion disk extends out to \~{}0.1 pc. For AGNs with smaller disks, or clusters of lower central density, giant stripping could supply gas enriched via stellar nucleosynthesis to a disk replenished from some other source. We find that, for typical parameters, this mechanism is able to supply important quantities of gas to the disk at lower stellar densities than previously proposed stellar fueling models for AGNs.},

Using a self-consistent model for the radiative transfer and the vertical temperature structure in a Shakura-Sunyaev disc, we simulate the observed disc spectra, taking into account Doppler blurring and gravitational redshift, and fit them with multicolour models. We show not only that such a model systematically underestimates the value of the inner-disc radius, but that when the accretion rate and/or the energy dissipated in the corona are allowed to change, the inner edge of the disc, as inferred from the multicolour model, appears to move even when it is in fact fixed at the innermost stable orbit.},

	N2 = {We examine the exchange of angular momentum between the component spins and the orbit in semi-detached double white dwarf binaries undergoing mass transfer through direct impact of the transfer stream. We approximate the stream as a series of discrete massive particles ejected in the ballistic limit at the inner Lagrangian point of the donor toward the accretor. This work improves upon similar earlier studies in a number of ways. First, we self-consistently calculate the total angular momentum of the orbit at all times. This includes changes in the orbital angular momentum during the ballistic trajectory of the ejected mass, as well as changes during the ejection/accretion due to the radial component of the particle's velocity. Second, we calculate the particle's ballistic trajectory for each system, which allows us to determine the precise position and velocity of the particle upon accretion. We can then include specific information about the radius of the accretor as well as the angle of impact. Finally, we ensure that the total angular momentum is conserved, which requires the donor star spin to vary self-consistently. We calculate the angular momentum change of the orbit and each binary component across the entire parameter space of direct impact double white dwarf binaries. We find a significant decrease in the amount of angular momentum removed from the orbit during mass transfer, as well as cases where this process increases the angular momentum of the orbit at the expense of the spin angular momentum of the donor. We conclude that, unlike earlier claims in the literature, mass transfer through direct impact need not destabilize the binary and that the quantity and sign of the orbital angular momentum transfer depends on the binary properties. This stabilization may significantly impact the population synthesis calculations of double white dwarf progenitors.},

Using post-Newtonian (PN) accurate equations that include 2.5PN accurate non-spinning contributions, the leading-order general relativistic and classical spin-orbit terms, the orbit of the binary black hole in OJ287 is calculated and as expected it depends on the spin of the primary black hole. Using the orbital solution, the specific times when the orbit of the secondary crosses the accretion disk of the primary are evaluated such that the record of observed outbursts from 1913 up to 2007 is reproduced. The timings of the outbursts are quite sensitive to the spin value. In order to reproduce all the known outbursts, including a newly discovered one in 1957, the Kerr parameter of the primary has to be 0.28 $\pm$0.08. The quadrupole-moment contributions to the equations of motion allow us to constrain the "no-hair" parameter to be 1.0 $\pm$0.3, where 0.3 is the 1σerror. This supports the "black hole no-hair theorem" within the achievable precision. It should be possible to test the present estimate in 2015 when the next outburst is due. The timing of the 2015 outburst is a strong function of the spin: if the spin is 0.36 of the maximal value allowed in general relativity, the outburst begins in early 2015 November, while the same event starts in the end of January 2016 if the spin is 0.2.},

Detailed expressions are derived for the relevant diffusion coefficients, the time-dependent Boltzmann equation is solved numerically, and solutions are found which satisfy the boundary conditions at both zero and large binding energy. The results indicate that the distribution function is approximately a power law throughout most of the black hole's gravitational well, that stars in bound orbits diffuse slowly down the gravitational well under equilibrium conditions, and that a black hole of less than or approximately 1000 solar masses may accrete stars primarily by capture from unbound orbits. Several methods for detecting massive black holes in cores of globular clusters are discussed along with expected large statistical fluctuations close to the black hole and the possible relevance of various stellar accretion processes for globular-cluster X-ray sources.},

	N2 = {We consider the problem of tidal disruption of stars in the centre of a galaxy containing a supermassive binary black hole with unequal masses. We assume that over the separation distance between the black holes, the gravitational potential is dominated by the more massive primary black hole. Also, we assume that the number density of stars is concentric with the primary black hole and has a power-law cusp. We show that the bulk of stars with a small angular-momentum component normal to the black hole binary orbit can reach a small value of total angular momentum through secular evolution in the gravitational field of the binary, and hence they can be tidally disrupted by the larger black hole. This effect is analogous to the so-called Kozai effect well known in celestial mechanics. We develop an analytical theory for the secular evolution of the stellar orbits and calculate the rate of tidal disruption. We compare our analytical theory with a simple numerical model and find very good agreement. Our results show that for a primary black hole mass of \~{}106-107Msolar, the black hole mass-ratio q > 10-2, cusp size \~{}1 pc, the tidal disruption rate can be as large as \~{}10-2-1Msolar yr-1. This is at least 102-104 times larger than estimated for the case of a single supermassive black hole. The duration of the phase of enhanced tidal disruption is determined by the dynamical-friction time-scale, and it is rather short: \~{}105 yr. The dependence of the tidal disruption rate on the mass ratio, and on the size of the cusp, is also discussed.},

Violent mergers of two carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) are a candidate scenario suggested to be responsible for at least a significant fraction of normal SNe Ia. Here, we simulate the merger of two CO WDs using a moving-mesh code that allows for the inclusion of thin helium (He) shells (0.01 M ⊙) on top of the WDs at an unprecedented numerical resolution. The accretion of He onto the primary WD leads to the formation of a detonation in its He shell. This detonation propagates around the CO WD and sends a converging shock wave into its core, known to robustly trigger a second detonation, as in the well-known double-detonation scenario for He-accreting CO WDs. However, in contrast to that scenario where a massive He shell is required to form a detonation through thermal instability, here the He detonation is ignited dynamically. Accordingly the required He-shell mass is significantly smaller, and hence its burning products are unlikely to affect the optical display of the explosion. We show that this scenario, which works for CO primary WDs with CO- as well as He-WD companions, has the potential to explain the different brightness distributions, delay times, and relative rates of normal and fast declining SNe Ia. Finally, we discuss extensions to our unified merger model needed to obtain a comprehensive picture of the full observed diversity of SNe Ia.},

We incorporate the physics of ideal inviscid hydrodynamical flow, Newtonian self-gravity, and radiation transport on a three-dimensional uniformly rotating cylindrical Eulerian grid. Care has been taken to conserve the key physical quantities such as angular momentum and energy. Our new method conserves total energy to a higher degree of accuracy than other codes that are presently being used to model mass transfer in DWD systems. We present the results of verification tests and simulate the first 20 + orbits of a binary system of mass ratio q = 0.7 at the onset of dynamically unstable direct impact mass transfer. The mass transfer rate quickly exceeds the critical Eddington limit by many orders of magnitude, and thus we are unable to model a trans-Eddington phase. It appears that radiation pressure does not significantly affect the accretion flow in the highly super-Eddington regime. An optically thick common envelope forms around the binary within a few orbits. Although this envelope quickly exceeds the spatial domain of the computational grid, the fraction of the common envelope that exceeds zero gravitational binding energy is extremely small, suggesting that radiation-driven mass loss is insignificant in this regime. It remains to be seen whether simulations that capture the trans-Eddington phase of such flows will lead to the same conclusion or show that substantial material gets expelled.},

In the local universe, it is possible to infer their properties from the surrounding stars or gas. However, at high redshifts we require active, continuous accretion to infer the presence of the SMBHs, which often comes in the form of long-term accretion in active galactic nuclei. SMBHs can also capture and tidally disrupt stars orbiting nearby, resulting in bright flares from otherwise quiescent black holes. Here, we report on a \~{}200-second x-ray quasi-periodicity around a previously dormant SMBH located in the center of a galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. This result may open the possibility of probing general relativity beyond our local universe.},

	N2 = {{$[$}Abridged{$]$} Millisecond duration bright radio pulses in the 1.4-GHz band and with inferred dispersion measures (DM) well in excess of Galactic values have been reported by Lorimer et al. and Thornton et al.. The all-sky rate of these events is large, \~{}10\^{}4 per day above \~{}1 Jy. To add to the mystery there now exists "Perytons'' -- also pulsed and dispersed sources but most certainly of local (artificial or atmospheric) origin. The suggested models now range from sources originating in the Earth's atmosphere, in stellar coronae, in other galaxies and at even cosmological distances. Using a series of physically motivated assumptions combined with the observed properties of these bursts, we explore possible constraints on sites or processes that can account for such high DMs. In our analysis, we focus on the first such reported event by Lorimer et al.: a 30 Jy, 5-ms duration burst with a dispersion measure of 375 cm\^{}-3 pc and exhibiting a steep frequency-dependent pulse width (hereafter dubbed as the Sparker). Assuming that the DM of the Sparker is produced by propagation through a cold plasma and using all available observations we constrain its distance to be greater than 300 kpc. A similar analysis on the four other reported events (all with larger DMs) would lead to a stronger conclusion, namely these "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)'' (the moniker given to this group by the discoverers) are of extragalactic origin, provided that the inferred DM arises due to propagation through cold plasma. We then explore proposed extra-galactic as well as stellar coronal models for FRBs and find most of them either unable to account for the high daily rate or have difficulty in having an ultra-clean explosion site (essential to the production of high brightness temperature pulse) or suffer from free-free absorption on length scales beyond the immediate production of the radio pulses.},

This phenomenon is observed even in the absence of any external magnetic field. Only the surface region of the fractured pieces are magnetised, with the fractured ends exhibiting distinct and opposite polarities. The magnetisation of each piece varies along the length, with maximum at the fractured end. Moreover, the induced magnetisation is retained for about 15 d in larger specimens and then decays almost exponentially. Iron specimens fractured under impact forces did not show any magnetisation.

	N2 = {Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies have low-mass black holes and mass accretion rates close to (or exceeding) Eddington, so a standard blackbody accretion disc should peak in the extreme ultraviolet. However, the lack of true absorption opacity in the disc means that the emission is better approximated by a colour temperature corrected blackbody, and this colour temperature correction is large enough (˜2.4) that the bare disc emission from a zero spin black hole can extend into the soft X-ray bandpass. Part of the soft X-ray excess seen in these objects must be intrinsic emission from the disc unless the vertical structure is very different to that predicted. None the less, this is not the whole story even for the extreme NLS1 as the shape of the soft excess is much broader than predicted by a bare disc spectrum, indicating some Compton upscattering by warm, optically thick material. We associate this with the disc itself, so it must ultimately be powered by mass accretion. We build an energetically self-consistent model assuming that the emission thermalizes to a (colour temperature corrected) blackbody only at large radii. At smaller radii the gravitational energy is split between powering optically thick Comptonized disc emission (forming the soft X-ray excess) and an optically thin corona above the disc (forming the tail to higher energies). We show examples of this model fit to the extreme NLS1 RE J1034+396, and to the much lower Eddington fraction broad-line Seyfert 1 PG 1048+231. We use these to guide our fits and interpretations of three template spectra made from co-adding multiple sources to track out a sequence of active galactic nucleus (AGN) spectra as a function of L/LEdd. Both the individual objects and template spectra show the surprising result that the Compton upscattered soft X-ray excess decreases in importance with increasing L/LEdd. The strongest soft excesses are associated with low mass accretion rate AGN rather than being tied to some change in disc structure around Eddington. We argue that this suggests a true break in accretion flow properties between stellar and supermassive black holes. The new model is publicly available within the XSPEC spectral fitting package.},

	N2 = {Galaxy centers are residing places for supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Galaxy mergers bring SMBHs close together to form gravitationally bound binary systems, which, if able to coalesce in less than a Hubble time, would be one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In spherical galaxy models, SMBH binaries stall at a separation of approximately 1 pc, leading to the "final parsec problem" (FPP). On the other hand, it has been shown that merger-induced triaxiality of the remnant in equal-mass mergers is capable of supporting a constant supply of stars on the so-called centrophilic orbits that interact with the binary and thus avoid the FPP. In this paper, using a set of direct N-body simulations of mergers of initially spherically symmetric galaxies with different mass ratios, we show that the merger-induced triaxiality is also able to drive unequal-mass SMBH binaries to coalescence. The binary hardening rates are high and depend only weakly on the mass ratios of SMBHs for a wide range of mass ratios q. There is, however, an abrupt transition in the hardening rates for mergers with mass ratios somewhere between q \~{} 0.05 and 0.1, resulting from the monotonic decrease of merger-induced triaxiality with mass ratio q, as the secondary galaxy becomes too small and light to significantly perturb the primary, i.e., the more massive one. The hardening rates are significantly higher for galaxies having steep cusps in comparison with those having shallow cups at centers. The evolution of the binary SMBH leads to relatively shallower inner slopes at the centers of the merger remnants. The stellar mass displaced by the SMBH binary on its way to coalescence is \~{}1-5 times the combined mass of binary SMBHs. The coalescence timescales for SMBH binary with mass \~{}106 M ⊙are less than 1 Gyr and for those at the upper end of SMBH masses 109 M ⊙are 1-2 Gyr for less eccentric binaries whereas they are less than 1 Gyr for highly eccentric binaries. SMBH binaries are thus expected to be promising sources of GWs at low and high redshifts.},

We compare the predicted radial and velocity distributions of HVSs with the limited-statistics data set currently available, and show that the IMBH model appears to produce a spectrum of ejection velocities that is too flat.

Three-body interactions create a subpopulation of HVSs on nearly radial orbits, with a spatial distribution that is initially highly flattened in the inspiral plane of the MBHB, but becomes more isotropic with decreasing binary separation. The degree of anisotropy is smaller for unequal mass binaries and larger for stars with higher kick velocities. Eccentric MBHBs produce a more prominent tail of high-velocity stars and break planar symmetry, ejecting HVSs along a broad jet perpendicular to the semimajor axis. The jet two-sidedness decreases with increasing binary mass ratio, while the jet opening angle increases with decreasing kick velocity and orbital separation. The detection of a numerous population of HVSs in the halo of the Milky Way by the next generation of large astrometric surveys such as Gaia may provide a unique signature of the history, nature, and environment of the MBH at the Galactic center.},

The fraction of these "hot-dust-poor" AGNs increases with redshift from 6{\%} at low redshift (z < 2) to 20{\%} at moderate high redshift (2 < z < 3.5). There is no clear trend of the fraction with other parameters: bolometric luminosity, Eddington ratio, black hole mass, and X-ray luminosity. The 3 μm emission relative to the 1 μm emission is a factor of 2-4 smaller than the typical Elvis et al. AGN spectral energy distribution (SED), which indicates a "torus" covering factor of 2{\%}-29{\%}, a factor of 3-40 smaller than required by unified models. The weak hot dust emission seems to expose an extension of the accretion disk continuum in some of the source SEDs. We estimate the outer edge of their accretion disks to lie at (0.3-2.0) ×104 Schwarzschild radii, \~{}10-23 times the gravitational stability radii. Formation scenarios for these sources are discussed.},

Such a process may have played an important role in the origin of irregular satellites or the dynamical evolution of short-period comets. Using three-body orbital integration, we study the temporary capture of planetesimals by a planet from their heliocentric eccentric orbits. We examine the dependence of the orbital characteristics during temporary capture as well as the rate of capture on the pre-capture heliocentric orbital parameters. We find that typical orbital size and direction of revolution around the planet change depending on planetesimals' initial eccentricity and energy. When initial eccentricity is so small that Kepler shear dominates the relative velocity between planetesimals and the planet, temporary capture typically occurs in the retrograde direction in the vicinity of the planet's Hill sphere, while large retrograde capture orbits outside the Hill sphere are predominant for large eccentricities. Long prograde capture occurs in a very narrow range of planetesimal eccentricity and energy. We obtain the rate of temporary capture of planetesimals and find that the rate of long capture increases with increasing eccentricity at low and high eccentricities, but decreases with increasing eccentricity in intermediate values of eccentricity. We also examine the dependence of capture rate on the duration of capture and find an approximate power-law dependence.},

Dynamical interactions involving BH binaries are computed exactly and are generated according to a Monte Carlo prescription. Recoil and ejections lead to complete evaporation of the BH core on a timescale \~{}109 yr for typical globular cluster parameters. Orbital decay driven by gravitational radiation can make binaries merge, and, in some cases, successive mergers can lead to significant BH growth. Our highly simplified treatment of the cluster dynamics allows us to study a large number of models and to compute statistical distributions of outcomes, such as the probability of massive BH growth and retention in a cluster. We find that, in most models, there is a significant probability (\~{}20{\%}-80{\%}) of BH growth with final masses >\~{}100 Msolar. In one case, a BH formed with mass \~{}620 Msolar. However, if the typical merger recoil speed (due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation) significantly exceeds the cluster escape speed, no growth ever occurs. Independent of the recoil speed, we find that BH-BH mergers enhanced by dynamical interactions in cluster cores present an important source of gravitational waves for ground-based laser interferometers. Under optimistic conditions, the total rate of detections by Advanced LIGO could be as high as a few tens of events per year from inspiraling BHs from clusters.},

Essential to this project is a universal calibration of the TF relation in the 2MASS J (1.2 μm), H (1.6 μm), and K (2.2 μm) bands. We present the first bias-corrected or universal TF template in these bands. We find that the slope of the TF relation becomes steeper as the wavelength increases being close to L vprop v 4 in the K band and L vprop v 3.6 in the J and H bands. We also investigate the dependence on galaxy morphology showing that in all three bands the relation is steeper for later-type spirals which also have a dimmer TF zero point than earlier-type spirals. We correct the final relation to that for Sc galaxies. Finally we study the scatter from the TF relation fitting for a width-dependent intrinsic scatter which is not found to vary significantly with wavelength.},

The astrometric observations obtained by modern digital sky surveys are enabling unprecedentedly massive and robust studies of the kinematics of the Milky Way. For example, the astrometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), together with half a century old astrometry from the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS), have enabled the construction of a catalog that includes absolute proper motions as accurate as 3 mas/year for about 20 million stars brighter than V=20, and for 80,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars which provide exquisite error assessment. We discuss here several ongoing studies of Milky Way kinematics based on this catalog. The upcoming next-generation surveys will maintain this revolutionary progress. For example, we show using realistic simulations that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will measure proper motions accurate to 1 mas/year to a limit 4 magnitude fainter than possible with SDSS and POSS catalogs, or with the Gaia survey. LSST will also obtain geometric parallaxes with accuracy similar to Gaia's at its faint end (0.3 mas at V=20), and extend them to V=24 with an accuracy of 3 mas. We discuss the impact that these LSST measurements will have on studies of the Milky Way kinematics, and potential synergies with the Gaia survey.},

The stripping of a galaxy's stars by the potential of a cluster in which it resides must also occur. This prediction is verified by the detections of classical novae, red giants, and planetary nebulae between the galaxies of the Virgo and Fornax Clusters. These tracers suggest a tramp stellar component of 10{\%}-40{\%} of the cluster baryonic mass. I point out that classical novae can usefully extend these results to the 250,000 Mpc3 of intergalactic space outside of galaxy clusters surrounding the Local Group. This is because individual novae are well-understood standard candles, with light curves and spectra that are distinct from all other astrophysical phenomena. In addition, the frequency of nova outbursts in any given galaxy is measured to be directly proportional to that galaxy's K-band luminosity (and independent of its Hubble type). Thus, intergalactic novae should be excellent tracers of the fraction of stars liberated from galaxies over the past 13 Gyr. Pan-STARRS, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and other large-area synoptic survey telescopes will begin to regularly discover tramp classical novae out to 20-40 Mpc in the coming decade. I estimate the expected discovery rates with LSST-like surveys to be hundreds of intergalactic tramp novae per year, and suggest survey parameters to optimize detections of these tramps.},

Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r\~{}27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z\~{}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

This will induce a violation of the universality of free fall. Thus, it is of utmost importance for our understanding of gravity and of the domain of validity of general relativity to test for their constancy. We detail the relations between the constants, the tests of the local position invariance and of the universality of free fall. We then review the main experimental and observational constraints that have been obtained from atomic clocks, the Oklo phenomenon, solar system observations, meteorite dating, quasar absorption spectra, stellar physics, pulsar timing, the cosmic microwave background and big bang nucleosynthesis. At each step we describe the basics of each system, its dependence with respect to the constants, the known systematic effects and the most recent constraints that have been obtained. We then describe the main theoretical frameworks in which the low-energy constants may actually be varying and we focus on the unification mechanisms and the relations between the variation of different constants. To finish, we discuss the more speculative possibility of understanding their numerical values and the apparent fine-tuning that they confront us with.},

Thus, for sufficiently small subtended solid angle, an object will appear-optically-the same shape to all observers. A sphere will photograph with precisely the same circular outline whether stationary or in motion with respect to the camera. An object of less symmetry than a sphere, such as a meter stick, will appear, when in rapid motion with respect to an observer, to have undergone rotation, not contraction. The extent of this rotation is given by the aberration angle (θ-θ'), in which θis the angle at which the object is seen by the observer and θ' is the angle at which the object would be seen by another observer at the same point stationary with respect to the object. Observers photographing the meter stick simultaneously from the same position will obtain precisely the same picture, except for a change in scale given by the Doppler shift ratio, irrespective of their velocity relative to the meter stick. Even if methods of measuring distance, such as stereoscopic photography, are used, the Lorentz contraction will not be visible, although correction for the finite velocity of light will reveal it to be present.},

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) was completed in 2003 and its final data products, including an extended source catalog (XSC), are available online. The 2MASS XSC contains nearly a million galaxies with Ks <= 13.5 mag and is essentially complete and mostly unaffected by interstellar extinction and stellar confusion down to a galactic latitude of {$|$}b{$|$} = 5$\,^{\circ}$for bright galaxies. Near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellar populations that dominate galaxy masses, making 2MASS an excellent starting point to study the distribution of matter in the nearby universe. We selected a sample of 44,599 2MASS galaxies with Ks <= 11.75 mag and {$|$}b{$|$} >= 5$\,^{\circ}$(>=8$\,^{\circ}$toward the Galactic bulge) as the input catalog for our survey. We obtained spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and used previously obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate a redshift catalog that is 97.6{\%} complete to well-defined limits and covers 91{\%} of the sky. This provides an unprecedented census of galaxy (baryonic mass) concentrations within 300 Mpc. Earlier versions of our survey have been used in a number of publications that have studied the bulk motion of the Local Group, mapped the density and peculiar velocity fields out to 50 h -1 Mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimated the values of several cosmological parameters. Additionally, we present morphological types for a nearly complete sub-sample of 20,860 galaxies with Ks <= 11.25 mag and {$|$}b{$|$} >= 10$\,^{\circ}$.},

	N2 = {We study the observational constraints on the growth of massive black holes (BHs) in galactic nuclei. We use the velocity dispersions of early-type galaxies obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the relation between BH mass and velocity dispersion to estimate the local BH mass density to be ρ*(z= 0) \~{}= (2.5 +/- 0.4) ×105h0.652Msolar Mpc-3. We also use the quasi-stellar object (QSO) luminosity function from the 2dF Redshift Survey to estimate the BH mass density accreted during optically bright QSO phases. The local BH mass density is consistent with the density accreted during optically bright QSO phases if QSOs have a mass-to-energy conversion efficiency ɛ\~{}= 0.1. By studying the continuity equation for the BH mass distribution, including the effect of BH mergers, we find relations between the local BH mass function and the QSO luminosity function. If the BH mass is assumed to be conserved during BH mergers, comparison of the predicted relations with the observations suggests that luminous QSOs (Lbol>\~{} 1046 erg s-1) have a high efficiency (e.g. ɛ\~{} 0.2, which is possible for thin-disc accretion on to a Kerr BH) and the growth of high-mass BHs (>\~{}108Msolar) comes mainly from accretion during optically bright QSO phases, or that luminous QSOs have a super-Eddington luminosity. If luminous QSOs are not accreting with super-Eddington luminosities and the growth of low-mass BHs also occurs mainly during optically bright QSO phases, less luminous QSOs must accrete with a low efficiency, <0.1 alternatively, they may accrete with high efficiency, but a significant fraction should be obscured. We estimate that the mean lifetime of luminous QSOs (Lbol>\~{} 1046 erg s-1) is (3-13) ×107 yr, which is comparable to the Salpeter time. We also investigate the case in which total BH mass decreases during BH mergers due to gravitational radiation; in the extreme case in which total BH entropy is conserved, the observations again suggest that BHs in most luminous QSOs are Kerr BHs accreting with an efficiency >\~{}0.1.},

	N2 = {Since many or most galaxies have central massive black holes (BHs), mergers of galaxies can form massive binary black holes (BBHs). In this paper we study the evolution of massive BBHs in realistic galaxy models, using a generalization of techniques used to study tidal disruption rates around massive BHs. The evolution of BBHs depends on BH mass ratio and host galaxy type. BBHs with very low mass ratios (say, <\~{}0.001) are hardly ever formed by mergers of galaxies, because the dynamical friction time-scale is too long for the smaller BH to sink into the galactic centre within a Hubble time. BBHs with moderate mass ratios are most likely to form and survive in spherical or nearly spherical galaxies and in high-luminosity or high-dispersion galaxies; they are most likely to have merged in low-dispersion galaxies (line-of-sight velocity dispersion <\~{}90kms-1 ) or in highly flattened or triaxial galaxies. The semimajor axes and orbital periods of surviving BBHs are generally in the range 10-3 -10pc and 10-105 yr they are also larger in high-dispersion galaxies than in low-dispersion galaxies, larger in nearly spherical galaxies than in highly flattened or triaxial galaxies, and larger for BBHs with equal masses than for BBHs with unequal masses. The orbital velocities of surviving BBHs are generally in the range 102 -104 kms-1 . The methods of detecting surviving BBHs are also discussed. If no evidence of BBHs is found in AGNs, this may be either because gas plays a major role in BBH orbital decay or because nuclear activity switches on soon after a galaxy merger, and ends before the smaller BH has had time to spiral to the centre of the galaxy.},

The eccentricity growth is found to be unimportant unless the binary forms with a large eccentricity. The scattering results suggest that a binary with masses m 1 ≥m 2 should not be considered hard until its orbital velocity exceeds the background velocity dispersion by a factor that scales as (1 +m 1/m 21/2).

The tidal force of the outer black hole on the inner binary produces eccentricity oscillations through the Kozai mechanism, and this can substantially reduce the gravitational wave merger time of the inner binary. We numerically calculate the merger time for a wide range of initial conditions and black hole mass ratios, including the effects of octupole interactions in the triple as well as general relativistic periastron precession in the inner binary. The semimajor axes and the mutual inclination of the inner and outer binaries are the most important factors affecting the merger time. We find that for a random distribution of inclination angles and approximately equal mass black holes, it is possible to reduce the merger time of a near circular inner binary by more than a factor of 10 in over 50{\%} of all cases. We estimate that a typical exterior quadrupole moment from surrounding matter in the galaxy may also be sufficient to excite eccentricity oscillations in supermassive black hole binaries and to accelerate black hole mergers.},

	N2 = {Tidal stellar disruptions have traditionally been discussed as a probe of the single, massive black holes (MBHs) that are dormant in the nuclei of galaxies. We have previously used numerical scattering experiments to show that three-body interactions between bound stars in a stellar cusp and a non-evolving "hard" MBH binary will also produce a burst of tidal disruptions, caused by a combination of the secular "Kozai effect" and by close resonant encounters with the secondary hole. Here, we derive basic analytical scalings of the stellar disruption rates with the system parameters, assess the relative importance of the Kozai and resonant encounter mechanisms as a function of time, discuss the impact of general relativistic (GR) and extended stellar cusp effects, and develop a hybrid model to self-consistently follow the shrinking of an MBH binary in a stellar background, including slingshot ejections and tidal disruptions. In the case of a fiducial binary with primary hole mass M 1 = 107 M sun and mass ratio q = M 2/M 1 = 1/81, embedded in an isothermal cusp, we derive a stellar disruption rate \dot{\{}N{\}}{\_}* ˜0.2 yr-1 lasting \~{}3 ×105 yr. This rate is three orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding value for a single MBH fed by two-body relaxation, confirming our previous findings. For q Lt 0.01, the Kozai/chaotic effect could be quenched due to GR/cusp effects by an order of magnitude, but even in this case the stellar-disruption rate is still two orders of magnitude larger than that given by standard relaxation processes around a single MBH. Our results suggest that gsim10{\%} of the tidal-disruption events may originate in MBH binaries.},

It begins by testing possible 'equilibrium' distributions for binaries against the results of computational experiments, but is mainly concerned with the dynamics of encounters between binaries and other members of the system. Using an impulsive approximation, it is shown that pairs with low binding energies tend to be disrupted by encounters. The theory for energetic pairs is complicated by the considerably richer variety of possible phenomena, including distant encounters in which changes in eccentricity much exceed changes in energy, and exchange events in which an incoming star may replace one component of the binary. The result of all types of encounter is that energetic pairs tend to become more energetic, at an average rate which is approximately independent of their binding energy.},

	N2 = {We have carried out general relativistic particle simulations of stars tidally disrupted by massive black holes. When a star is disrupted in a bound orbit with moderate eccentricity instead of a parabolic orbit, the temporal behavior of the resulting stellar debris changes qualitatively. The debris is initially all bound, returning to pericenter in a short time about the original stellar orbital timescale. The resulting fallback rate can thus be much higher than the Eddington rate. Furthermore, if the star is disrupted close to the hole, in a regime where general relativity is important, the stellar and debris orbits display general relativistic precession. Apsidal precession can make the debris stream cross itself after several orbits, likely leading to fast debris energy dissipation. If the star is disrupted in an inclined orbit around a spinning hole, nodal precession reduces the probability of self-intersection, and circularization may take many dynamical timescales, delaying the onset of flare activity. An examination of the particle dynamics suggests that quasi-periodic flares with short durations, produced when the center of the tidal stream passes pericenter, may occur in the early-time light curve. The late-time light curve may still show power-law behavior which is generic to disk accretion processes. The detection triggers for future surveys should be extended to capture such "non-standard" short-term flaring activity before the event enters the asymptotic decay phase, as this activity is likely to be more sensitive to physical parameters such as the black hole spin.},

The extragalactic interpretation was based on the swept-frequency nature of the event, which followed the dispersive delay expected from an extragalactic pulse. We report here on the detection of 16 pulses, the bulk of which exhibit a frequency sweep with a shape and magnitude resembling the Lorimer Burst. These new events were detected in a sidelobe of the Parkes Telescope and are of clearly terrestrial origin, with properties unlike any known sources of terrestrial broadband radio emission. The new detections cast doubt on the extragalactic interpretation of the original burst, and call for further sophistication in radio-pulse survey techniques to identify the origin of the anomalous terrestrial signals and definitively distinguish future extragalactic pulse detections from local signals. The ambiguous origin of these seemingly dispersed, swept-frequency signals suggests that radio-pulse searches using multiple detectors will be the only experiments able to provide definitive information about the origin of new swept-frequency radio burst detections.},

	N2 = {ASASSN-14ae is a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) found at the center of SDSS J110840.11+340552.2 ({\$}d\simeq200{\$} Mpc) by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), a global array of 14-cm telescopes. The host galaxy is an early type spiral with no signs of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and with little recent star formation. We present follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations of the source, including optical data from ground-based telescopes and ultraviolet and optical data from Swift. From blackbody fits to the host-subtracted spectral energy distribution, we find that the transient had a peak luminosity of {\$}L\simeq8\times10\^{}{\{}43{\}}{\$} erg s{\$}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} and a total integrated energy of {\$}E\simeq1.5\times10\^{}{\{}50{\}}{\$} ergs over the {\$}\sim3{\$} months of observations presented. The blackbody temperature of the transient remains roughly constant at {\$}T\sim20,000{\$} K while the luminosity declines by nearly 1.5 orders of magnitude during this time, a drop that is most consistent with an exponential, {\$}L\propto e\^{}{\{}-t/t{\_}0{\}}{\$} with {\$}t{\_}0\simeq32.5{\$} days. The source has broad Balmer lines in emission at all epochs, with the Hαwidth evolving from {\$}\sim17000{\$} km s{\$}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} near discovery to {\$}\sim8000{\$} km s{\$}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} three months later. We also detect broad He II in our latest spectrum. We compare the color and spectral evolution to both supernovae (SNe) and normal AGN to show that ASASSN-14ae does not resemble either type of object and conclude that a TDE is the most likely explanation for our observations. At {\$}z=0.0436{\$}, ASASSN-14ae is the lowest-redshift TDE candidate discovered at optical/UV wavelengths to date, and based on its discovery in the first year of ASAS-SN operations, we estimate that ASAS-SN may discover {\$}1-2{\$} of these events per year in the future.},

	N2 = {After the destruction of the star during a tidal disruption event (TDE), the cataclysmic encounter between a star and the supermassive black hole (SMBH) of a galaxy, approximately half of the original stellar debris falls back onto the hole at a rate that can initially exceed the Eddington limit by orders of magnitude. We argue that the angular momentum of this matter is too low to allow it to attain a disk-like configuration with accretion proceeding at a mildly super-Eddington rate, the excess energy being carried away by a combination of radiative losses and radially distributed winds. Instead, we propose that the infalling gas traps accretion energy until it inflates into a weakly bound, quasi-spherical structure with gas extending nearly to the poles. We study the structure and evolution of such "zero-Bernoulli accretion" flows as a model for the super-Eddington phase of TDEs. We argue that such flows cannot stop extremely super-Eddington accretion from occurring, and that once the envelope is maximally inflated, any excess accretion energy escapes through the poles in the form of powerful jets. We compare the predictions of our model to Swift J1644+57, the putative super-Eddington TDE, and show that it can qualitatively reproduce some of its observed features. Similar models, including self-gravity, could be applicable to gamma-ray bursts from collapsars and the growth of SMBH seeds inside quasi-stars.},

	N2 = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are an emerging class of bright, highly dispersed radio pulses. Recent work by Thornton et al. (2013) has revealed a population of FRBs in the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey at high Galactic latitudes. A variety of progenitors have been proposed including cataclysmic events at cosmological distances, Galactic flare stars, and terrestrial radio frequency interference. Here we report on a search for FRBs at intermediate Galactic latitudes ({\$}-15\^{}{\{}\circ{\}}{\$} {\$}< b <{\$} 15{\$}\^{}{\{}\circ{\}}{\$}) in data taken as part of the HTRU survey. No FRBs were discovered in this region. Several effects such as dispersion, scattering, sky temperature and scintillation decrease the sensitivity by more than 3{\$}\sigma{\$} in {\$}\sim{\$}20\{\%} of survey pointings. Including all of these effects, we exclude the hypothesis that FRBs are uniformly distributed on the sky with 99\{\%} confidence. This low probability implies that additional factors -- not accounted for by standard Galactic models -- must be included to ease the discrepancy between the detection rates at high and low Galactic latitudes. A revised rate estimate or another strong and heretofore unknown selection effect in Galactic latitude would provide closer agreement between the surveys' detection rates. The dearth of detections at low Galactic latitude disfavors a Galactic origin for these bursts.},

For a total of 30 galaxies bulge masses were derived through Jeans equation modeling or adopted from dynamical models in the literature. In stellar mass-to-light ratios, the spheroids and bulges span a range of a factor of 8. The bulge masses were related to well-determined black hole masses taken from the literature. With these improved values for Mbh, compared to Magorrian et al., and our redetermination of Mbulge, we find that the Mbh-Mbulge relation becomes very tight. We find Mbh\~{}M1.12+/-0.06bulge with an observed scatter of <\~{}0.30 dex, a fraction of which can be attributed to measurement errors. The scatter in this relation is therefore comparable to the scatter in the relations of Mbh with σand the stellar concentration. These results confirm and refine the work of Marconi \& Hunt. For Mbulge\~{}5×1010 Msolar the median black hole mass is 0.14{\%}+/-0.04{\%} of the bulge mass.},

	N2 = {Recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated, millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (DMs). These bursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalactic sources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities for probing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new source classes. Until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been detected with the Parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting some concern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. Here we present FRB 121102, the first FRB discovery from a geographic location other than Parkes. FRB 121102 was found in the Galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-GHz Pulsar ALFA survey with the Arecibo Observatory with a DM = 557.4 {\$}\pm{\$} 3 pc cm{\$}\^{}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, pulse width of {\$}3\; \pm 0.5{\$} ms, and no evidence of interstellar scattering. The observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agrees precisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. Despite its low Galactic latitude ({\$}b = -0.2\^{}{\{}\circ{\}}{\$}), the burst has three times the maximum Galactic DM expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting an extragalactic origin. A peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum; we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the ALFA receiver. FRB 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate are all consistent with the properties of the previously detected Parkes bursts.},

The pulse has a dispersion measure of 746 cm-3 pc, a peak flux density of 400 mJy for the observed pulse width of 7.8 ms and a flat spectrum across a 288-MHz band centred on 1374 MHz. The flat spectrum suggests that the pulse did not originate from a pulsar, but is consistent with radio-emitting magnetar spectra. The non-detection of subsequent bursts constrains any possible pulsar period to ≳1 s, and the pulse energy distribution to being much flatter than typical giant pulse emitting pulsars. The burst is also consistent with the radio signal theorized from an annihilating mini black hole. Extrapolating the PMPS detection rate provides a limit of ? on the density of these objects. We investigate the consistency of these two scenarios, plus several other possible solutions, as potential explanations to the origin of the pulse, as well as for another transient with similar properties: the Lorimer burst.},

The timescales for the formation and the coalescence of black hole binaries are still poorly constrained, resulting in large uncertainties in the expected rate of massive black hole binaries detectable in the electromagnetic and gravitational wave spectra. Here we review the current theoretical understanding of the black hole pairing in galaxy mergers, with a particular attention to recent developments and open issues. We conclude with a review of the expected observational signatures of massive binaries, and of the candidates discussed in literature to date.},

	N2 = {Resent observations and theoretical interpretations suggest that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; 100-105 Msolar) are formed in the centers of young and compact star clusters born close to the center of their parent galaxy. Such a star cluster would sink toward the center of the galaxy, and at the same time stars are stripped out of the cluster by the tidal field of the parent galaxy. We investigated the orbital evolution of the IMBH, after its parent cluster is completely disrupted by the tidal field of the parent galaxy, by means of large-scale N-body simulations. We constructed a model of the central region of our galaxy, with a supermassive black hole (SMBH; >=106 Msolar) and Bahcall-Wolf stellar cusp, and placed an IMBH in a circular orbit of radius 0.086 pc. The IMBH sinks toward the SMBH through dynamical friction, but dynamical friction becomes ineffective when the IMBH reaches the radius inside which the initial stellar mass is comparable to the IMBH mass. This is because the IMBH kicks out the stars. This behavior is essentially the same as the loss-cone depletion observed in simulations of massive SMBH binaries. After the evolution through dynamical friction stalled, the eccentricity of the orbit of the IMBH goes up, resulting in the strong reduction of the merging timescale through gravitational wave radiation. Our result indicates that the IMBHs formed close to the galactic center can merge with the central SMBH in short time. The number of merging events detectable with DECIGO or BBO is estimated to be around 50 yr-1. The event rate for LISA would be similar or less, depending on the growth mode of IMBHs.},

	N2 = {We construct evolutionary tracks for massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) embedded in a surrounding distribution of stars. The dynamics of the binary is evolved by taking into account the erosion of the central stellar cusp bound to the massive black holes, the scattering of unbound stars feeding the binary loss cone, and the emission of gravitational waves (GWs). Stellar dynamics is treated in a hybrid fashion by coupling the results of numerical three-body scattering experiments of bound and unbound stars to an analytical framework for the evolution of the stellar density distribution and for the efficiency of the binary loss-cone refilling. Our main focus is on the behavior of the binary eccentricity, in the attempt of addressing its importance in the merger process and its possible impact for GW detection with the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and ongoing and forthcoming pulsar timing array (PTA) campaigns. We produce a family of evolutionary tracks extensively sampling the relevant parameters of the system which are the binary mass, mass ratio and initial eccentricity, the slope of the stellar density distribution, its normalization and the efficiency of loss-cone refilling. We find that, in general, stellar dynamics causes a dramatic increase of the MBHB eccentricity, especially for initially already mildly eccentric and/or unequal mass binaries. This affects the overall system dynamics; high eccentricities enhance the efficiency of GW emission, accelerating the final coalescence process. When applied to standard MBHB population models, our results predict eccentricities in the ranges 10-3-0.2 and 0.03-0.3 for sources detectable by LISA and PTA, respectively. Such figures may have a significant impact on the signal modeling, on source detection, and on the development of parameter estimation algorithms.},

	N2 = {The detection of six Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has recently been reported. FRBs are short duration ({\$}\sim{\$} 1 ms), highly dispersed radio pulses from astronomical sources. The physical interpretation for the FRBs remains unclear but is thought to involve highly compact objects at cosmological distance. It has been suggested that a fraction of FRBs could be physically associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recent radio observations of GRBs have reported the detection of two highly dispersed short duration radio pulses using a 12 m radio telescope at 1.4 GHz. Motivated by this result, we have performed a systematic and sensitive search for FRBs associated with GRBs. We have observed five GRBs at 2.3 GHz using a 26 m radio telescope located at the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory, Hobart. The radio telescope was automated to rapidly respond to Gamma-ray Coordination Network notifications from the Swift satellite and slew to the GRB position within {\$}\sim{\$} 140 s. The data were searched for pulses up to 5000 pc {\$}\rm cm\^{}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} in dispersion measure and pulse widths ranging from 640 {\$}\rm \mu{\$}s to 25.60 ms. We did not detect any events {\$}\rm \geq 6 \sigma{\$}. An in-depth statistical analysis of our data shows that events detected above {\$}\rm 5 \sigma{\$} are consistent with thermal noise fluctuations only. A joint analysis of our data with previous experiments shows that previously claimed detections of FRBs from GRBs are unlikely to be astrophysical. Our results are in line with the lack of consistency noted between the recently presented FRB event rates and GRB event rates.},

In this Letter, we demonstrate that binary stars can be ejected out of the Galactic center with velocities up to 103 km s-1, while preserving their integrity, through interactions with a massive binary black hole. Binary stars are unlikely to attain such high velocities via scattering by a single massive black hole or through any other mechanisms. On the basis of the above theoretical prediction, we propose a search for binary systems among the hypervelocity stars. Discovery of hypervelocity binary stars, even one, is definitive evidence of the existence of a massive binary black hole in the Galactic center.},

	N2 = {The inspiral and merger of eccentric binaries leads to gravitational waveforms distinct from those generated by circularly merging binaries. Dynamical environments can assemble binaries with high eccentricity and peak frequencies within the LIGO band. In this paper, we study binary-single stellar scatterings occurring in dense stellar systems as a source of eccentrically inspiraling binaries. Many interactions between compact binaries and single objects are characterized by chaotic resonances in which the binary-single system undergoes many exchanges before reaching a final state. During these chaotic resonances, a pair of objects has a non-negligible probability of experiencing a very close passage. Significant orbital energy and angular momentum are carried away from the system by gravitational wave (GW) radiation in these close passages, and in some cases this implies an inspiral time shorter than the orbital period of the bound third body. We derive the cross section for such dynamical inspiral outcomes through analytical arguments and through numerical scattering experiments including GW losses. We show that the cross section for dynamical inspirals grows with increasing target binary semi-major axis a and that for equal-mass binaries it scales as a 2/7. Thus, we expect wide target binaries to predominantly contribute to the production of these relativistic outcomes. We estimate that eccentric inspirals account for approximately 1{\%} of dynamically assembled non-eccentric merging binaries. While these events are rare, we show that binary-single scatterings are a more effective formation channel than single-single captures for the production of eccentrically inspiraling binaries, even given modest binary fractions.},

In the case of mass excretion rates similar to the mass-loss rate estimated for Be stars, the irradiative heating by the central star is as essential for the disk structure as the viscous heating in the disk. It is demonstrated that the irradiated excretion disks around Be stars have a thermally unstable region, when the mass excretion rate is of the order of 10 to the -7th solar masses/yr.},

	N2 = {The evolution of an accretion disk, formed as a consequence of the disruption of a star by a black hole, is followed by solving numerically hydrodynamic equations. The present investigation aims to study the dependence of resulting light curves on dynamical and physical properties of such a transient disk during its existence. One of the main results derived from our simulations is that blackbody fits of X-ray data tend to overestimate the true mean disk temperature. In fact, the temperature derived from blackbody fits should be identified with the color X-ray temperature rather than the average value derived from the true temperature distribution along the disk. The time interval between the beginning of the circularization of the bound debris and the beginning of the accretion process by the black hole is determined by the viscous (or accretion) timescale, which also fixes the rising part of the resulting light curve. The luminosity peak coincides with the beginning of matter accretion by the black hole and the late evolution of the light curve depends on the evolution of the debris fallback rate. Peak bolometric luminosities are in the range 1045-1046 erg s-1, whereas peak luminosities in soft X-rays (0.2-2.0 keV) are typically one order of magnitude lower. The typical timescale derived from our preferred models for the flare luminosity to decay by two orders of magnitude is about 3-4 yr. Predicted soft X-ray light curves reproduce quite well data on galaxies in which a variable X-ray emission possibly related to a tidal event was detected. In the cases of NGC 3599 and IC 3599, data are reproduced well by models defined by a black hole with mass \~{}107 M sun and a disrupted star of about 1 solar mass. The X-ray variation observed in XMMSL1 is consistent with a model defined by a black hole with mass \~{}3 ×106 M sun and a disrupted star of 1 solar mass, while that observed in the galaxy situated in the cluster A1689 is consistent with a model including a black hole of \~{}107 M sun and a disrupted star of \~{}0.5 M sun.},

First, we have examined the situation where the Super-Earth is on the internal orbit and the gas giant on the external one. It has been found that the terrestrial planet is scattered from the disc or the gas giant captures the Super-Earth into an interior 3:2 or 4:3 mean-motion resonance. The stability of the latter configurations depends on the initial planet positions and on eccentricity evolution. The behaviour of the system is different if the Super-Earth is the external planet. We have found that instead of being captured in the mean-motion resonance, the terrestrial planet is trapped at the outer edge of the gap opened by the gas giant. This effect prevents the occurrence of the first order mean-motion commensurability. These results are particularly interesting in light of recent exoplanet discoveries and provide predictions of what will become observationally testable in the near future.},

The results show that stars in thermal equilibrium with isentropic surface layers are linearly unstable if the mass ratio exceeds a finite critical threshold q(0). Unless the mass fraction in these surface layers is quite small, q(0) is of the order of unity. On the other hand, stars in thermal equilibrium with subadiabatic surface layers are linearly stable for any value of the mass ratio. A finite-amplitude instability exists to which radiative stars are subject. If the initial phases of mass transfer are sufficiently rapid, such a star may undergo a delayed transition to dynamical time scale mass loss. Red giants with small core mass fractions behave very much like fully convective stars, expanding adiabatically as they lose mass.},

The precise localization at the center of a z = 0.35 galaxy argues for activity of the central engine as the underlying cause. We look at the suggestion by Bloom et al. of the possibility of a TDE. We argue that Sw 1644+57 cannot be explained by the traditional TDE model in which the periastron distance is close to the tidal disruption radius---three independent lines of argument indicate the orbit must be deeply plunging or else the powerful jet we are observing could not be produced. These arguments stem from (1) comparing the early X-ray light curve to the expected theoretical fallback rate, (2) looking at the time of transition to disk-dominated decay, and (3) considering the TDE rate. Due to the extreme excess in the tidal force above that which would be required minimally to disrupt the star in a deeply plunging orbit at periastron, we suggest this scenario might be referred to more descriptively as a tidal obliteration event (TOE) rather than a TDE.},

The model is based on a linear combination of stochastic processes and is also the solution to the linear diffusion equation perturbed by a spatially correlated noise field. This allows flexible modeling of the power spectral density (PSD), and we derive the likelihood function for the process, enabling one to estimate the parameters of the process, including break frequencies in the PSD. Our statistical technique is computationally efficient, unbiased by aliasing and red noise leak, and fully accounts for irregular sampling and measurement errors. We show that our stochastic model provides a good approximation to the X-ray light curves of galactic black holes, and the optical and X-ray light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We use the estimated timescales of our stochastic model to recover the correlation between characteristic timescale of the high-frequency X-ray fluctuations and black hole mass for AGNs, including two new "detections" of the timescale for Fairall 9 and NGC 5548. We find a tight anti-correlation between the black hole mass and the amplitude of the driving noise field, which is proportional to the amplitude of the high-frequency X-ray PSD, and we estimate that this parameter gives black hole mass estimates to within \~{}0.2 dex precision, potentially the most accurate method for AGNs yet. We also find evidence that ≈13{\%} of AGN optical PSDs fall off flatter than 1/f 2 and, similar to previous work, find that the optical fluctuations are more suppressed on short timescales compared to the X-rays, but are larger on long timescales, suggesting that the optical fluctuations are not solely due to reprocessing of X-rays.},

	N2 = {A long-standing question is whether active galactic nuclei (AGN) vary like Galactic black hole systems when appropriately scaled up by mass. If so, we can then determine how AGN should behave on cosmological timescales by studying the brighter and much faster varying Galactic systems. As X-ray emission is produced very close to the black holes, it provides one of the best diagnostics of their behaviour. A characteristic timescale-which potentially could tell us about the mass of the black hole-is found in the X-ray variations from both AGN and Galactic black holes, but whether it is physically meaningful to compare the two has been questioned. Here we report that, after correcting for variations in the accretion rate, the timescales can be physically linked, revealing that the accretion process is exactly the same for small and large black holes. Strong support for this linkage comes, perhaps surprisingly, from the permitted optical emission lines in AGN whose widths (in both broad-line AGN and narrow-emission-line Seyfert 1 galaxies) correlate strongly with the characteristic X-ray timescale, exactly as expected from the AGN black hole masses and accretion rates. So AGN really are just scaled-up Galactic black holes.},

A simple Taylor expansion in Δt of the exact simulation formulas shows how the first-order simulation formulas, which are implicit in the Langevin equation for X(t) and the defining equation for Y(t), are modified in second order. The exact simulation algorithm is used here to illustrate the zero-τlimit theorem.},

	N2 = {We present continued radio observations of the tidal disruption event Swift J164449.3+573451 extending to δt ≈216 days after discovery. The data were obtained with the EVLA, AMI Large Array, CARMA, the SMA, and the VLBA+Effelsberg as part of a long-term program to monitor the expansion and energy scale of the relativistic outflow, and to trace the parsec-scale environment around a previously dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH). The new observations reveal a significant change in the radio evolution starting at δt ≈1 month, with a brightening at all frequencies that requires an increase in the energy by about an order of magnitude, and an overall density profile around the SMBH of ρvpropr -3/2 (0.1-1.2 pc) with a significant flattening at r ≈0.4-0.6 pc. The increase in energy cannot be explained with continuous injection from an Lvpropt -5/3 tail, which is observed in the X-rays. Instead, we conclude that the relativistic jet was launched with a wide range of Lorentz factors, obeying E(> Γj )vpropΓ-2.5 j . The similar ratios of duration to dynamical timescale for Sw 1644+57 and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggest that this result may be applicable to GRB jets as well. The radial density profile may be indicative of Bondi accretion, with the inferred flattening at r \~{} 0.5 pc in good agreement with the Bondi radius for a \~{}few ×106 M \&sun; black hole. The density at \~{}0.5 pc is about a factor of 30 times lower than inferred for the Milky Way Galactic Center, potentially due to a smaller number of mass-shedding massive stars. From our latest observations (δt ≈216 days) we find that the jet energy is E j, iso ≈5 ×1053 erg (Ej ≈2.4 ×1051 erg for θj = 0.1), the radius is r ≈1.2 pc, the Lorentz factor is Γj ≈2.2, the ambient density is n ≈0.2 cm-3, and the projected angular size is r proj ≈25 μas, below the resolution of the VLBA+Effelsberg. Assuming no future changes in the observed evolution and a final integrated total energy of Ej ≈1052 erg, we predict that the radio emission from Sw 1644+57 should be detectable with the EVLA for several decades and will be resolvable with very long baseline interferometry in a few years.},

We analyze stars in a marginally bound orbit around the black hole with pericentric separation of a few Schwarzschild radii. We show that during a close passage, as a result of relativistic effects analogous to the perihelion shift, the trajectories of the debris of the star fan out into a crescent-like shape centered on the black hole. We also discuss the increase of the central density of the star as it approaches pericentric distance, the fraction of the debris accreted by the hole, its accretion rate, the distribution of debris orbits bound to the hole, and the velocity of unbound ejected material. We compare these results with the disruption of the star by a Newtonian point mass.},

Disk-driven migration is faster than the moons' tidal orbital evolution. Moons are eventually ejected from around close-in exoplanets or forced into collision with them before tides from the planet affect their orbits. If moons are detected around close-in exoplanets, they are unlikely to have been formed in situ, instead they were captured from the protoplanetary disk on retrograde orbits around the planets.},

Disruption of a white dwarf rather than a main-sequence star offers a number of advantages in understanding the multiple, and short, timescales seen in the light curve of this system. In particular, the short internal dynamical timescale of a white dwarf offers a more natural way of understanding the short rise times (\~{}100 s) observed. The relatively long intervals between flares (\~{}5 ×104 s) may also be readily understood as the period between successive pericenter passages of the remnant white dwarf. In addition, the expected jet power is larger when a white dwarf is disrupted. If this model is correct, the black hole responsible must have a mass <\~{} 105 M \&sun;.},

	N2 = {Tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by black holes has generally been thought to lead to a signal dominated by UV emission. If, however, the black hole spins rapidly and the poloidal magnetic field intensity on the black hole horizon is comparable to the inner accretion disk pressure, a powerful jet may form whose luminosity can easily exceed the thermal UV luminosity. When the jet beam points at Earth, its non-thermal luminosity can dominate the emitted spectrum. The thermal and non-thermal components decay differently with time. In particular, the thermal emission should remain roughly constant for a significant time after the period of maximum accretion, beginning to diminish only after a delay, whereas after the peak accretion rate, the non-thermal jet emission decays, but then reaches a plateau. Both transitions are tied to a characteristic timescale t Edd at which the accretion rate falls below Eddington. Making use of this timescale in a new parameter-inference formalism for tidal disruption events with significant emission from a jet, we analyze the recent flare source Swift J2058. It is consistent with an event in which a main-sequence solar-type star is disrupted by a black hole of mass \~{}4 ×107 M \&sun;. The beginning of the flat phase in the non-thermal emission from this source can possibly be seen in the late-time light curve. Optical photometry over the first \~{}= 40 days of this flare is also consistent with this picture, but is only weakly constraining because the bolometric correction is very uncertain. We suggest that future searches for main-sequence tidal disruptions use methods sensitive to jet radiation as well as to thermal UV radiation.},

	N2 = {A one-armed spiral instability has been found to develop in differentially rotating stellar models that have a relatively stiff, n=1 polytropic equation of state and a wide range of rotational energies. This suggests that such instabilities can arise in neutron stars that are differentially, although not necessarily rapidly, rotating. The instability seems to be directly triggered by the presence of a corotation resonance inside the star. Our analysis also suggests that a resonant cavity resulting from a local minimum in the radial vortensity profile of the star plays an important role in amplifying the unstable mode. Hence, it appears as though this instability is closely related to the so-called Rossby wave instability (see work of Lovelace et al.) that has been found to arise in accretion disks. In addition to the one-armed (m=1) spiral mode, we have found that higher order (m=2 and 3) nonaxisymmetric modes also can become unstable if corotation points that resonate with the eigenfrequencies of these higher order modes also appear inside the star. The growth rate of each mode seems to depend on the location of its corotation radius with respect to the vortensity profile (or on the depth of its corotation radius inside the vortensity well). The existence of such instabilities makes the stability criterion for differentially rotating neutron stars nonunique. Also, the gravitational waves emitted from such unstable systems generally will not have a monochromatic frequency spectrum.},

Calculations are carried out for a region including only the mass-losing star, thus not the mass accreting star. The equation of state is that of an ideal gas characterized by a specific heat ratio gamma , and the case with gamma =5/3 is mainly studied. A system of eddies appears on the surface of the companion star: an eddy in the low pressure region near the L1 point, one around the high pressure at the north pole, and one or two eddies around the low pressure at the opposite side of the L1 point. Gas elements starting near the pole region rotate clockwise around the north pole (here the binary system rotates counter-clockwise as seen from the north pole). Because of viscosity, the gas drifts to the equatorial region, switches to the counter-clockwise eddy near the L1 point and flows through the L1 point to finally form the L1 stream. The flow field in the L1 region and the structure of the L1 stream are also considered.},

	N2 = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out. Published in: SIAM Review 51, 661-703 (2009)},

A wide range of temperatures, densities, and compositions are considered-conditions appropriate for modeling the collapse of a cloud of hydrogen gas (or an exploding supernova) to the outer layers of a neutron star. The pressures and specific thermal energies calculated by each equation-of-state routine are reasonably accurate (typically 0.1{\%} error or less) and agree remarkably well with each other, despite the different approaches and approximations used in each routine. The derivatives of the pressure and specific thermal energies with respect to the temperature and density generally show less accuracy (typically 1{\%} error or less) and more disagreement with one another. Thermodynamic consistency, as measured by deviations from the appropriate Maxwell relations, shows that the Timmes equation of state and the Nadyozhin equation of state achieve thermodynamic consistency to a high degree of precision. The execution speed of the five equation-of-state routines-evaluated across several different machine architectures, compiler options, and modes of operation-differ dramatically. The Arnett equation of state is the fastest of the five routines, with the Nadyozhin equation of state close behind.},

This model is effectively a one-dimensional Lagrangian model and it can be evolved numerically much faster than the conventional three-dimensional (3D) models. A self-consistent derivation of dynamical equations of the model is performed and several important theorems concerning the dynamics of the model are proved without any particular assumptions concerning the equation of state of the stellar gas. The dynamical equations are solved numerically for the case of an n= 1.5 polytropic star evolving in the relativistic tidal field of a 107-Msolar Kerr black hole. Some results of these calculations are compared with the results of calculations based on finite-difference 3D simulations. The comparison shows a very good agreement between both approaches to the problem. Then we show that the strength of the tidal encounter depends significantly on the relative orientation of the orbital angular momentum of the star and the spin of the black hole.},

The present paper considers two additional effects: the asteroid's nonzero heliocentric eccentricity and solar radiation pressure. Results of numerical analyses show that, for an asteroid on an eccentric orbit, the stability zone scales roughly as the size of the Hill sphere calculated at the asteroid's pericenter. It was also found that solar radiation pressure is a very efficient mechanism for removing small (on the order of 0.1 mm) particles from circular asteroidal zone. Particles larger than a few centimeters are only slightly affected by radiation pressure. The results are applied to the Gaspra 951 asteroid.},

For black holes with mass M≳107M\&sun;, tidal disruption of main-sequence stars occurs close enough to the event horizon that a Newtonian treatment of the tidal field is no longer valid. The fraction of stars that are directly captured is also no longer negligible. We calculate generically oriented stellar orbits in the Kerr metric, and evaluate the relativistic tidal tensor at the pericenter for those stars not directly captured by the black hole. We combine this relativistic analysis with previous calculations of how these orbits are populated to determine tidal-disruption rates for spinning black holes. We find, consistent with previous results, that black-hole spin increases the upper limit on the mass of a black hole capable of tidally disrupting solarlike stars to ˜7×108M\&sun;. More quantitatively, we find that direct stellar capture reduces tidal-disruption rates by a factor ˜2/3(1/10) at M≃107(108)M\&sun;. The strong dependence of tidal-disruption rates on black-hole spin for M≳108M\&sun; implies that future surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope that discover thousands of tidal-disruption events can constrain supermassive black-hole spin demographics.},

Using a numerically fast Lagrangian model of a tidally disrupted star developed in our previous works, we survey the parameter space of the problem and find regions where the total disruption of the star or a partial mass loss from the star takes place as a result of fly-by around the black hole. Our treatment is based on General Relativity, and we consider a range of black hole masses where the tidal disruption competes with the relativistic effect of direct capture of stars by the black hole. We model the star as a full polytrope with n=1.5 with the solar mass and radius. We show that our results can also be used to obtain the amount of mass lost by stars with different stellar masses and radii.Results.We find that the results can be conveniently represented on the plane of specific orbital angular momenta of the star (jθ, jφ). We calculate the contours of a given mass loss of the star on this plane, for a given black hole mass M, rotational parameter a and inclination of the trajectory of the star with respect to the black hole equatorial plane. In the following such contours are referred to as the tidal cross sections. It is shown that the tidal cross sections can be approximated as circles symmetric above the axis jφ=0, and shifted with respect to the origin of the coordinates in the direction of negative jθ. The radii and shifts of these circles are obtained numerically for the black hole masses in the range 5×105\~{}M\&sun;-109\~{}M\&sun; and different values of a. It is shown that when a=0 tidal disruption takes place for M < 5×107\~{}M\&sun; and when a≈1 tidal disruption is possible for M < 109\~{}M\&sun;.},

These encounters require a full general relativistic treatment of gravity. We show that the disruption process and prompt accretion of the debris strongly depend on the magnitude and orientation of the black hole (BH) spin. However, the late-time accretion onto the BH follows the same decay, \dot{\{}M{\}} \propto \,t\^{}{\{}-5/3{\}}, estimated from Newtonian gravity disruption studies. We compute the spectrum of the disk formed from the fallback material using a slim disk model. The disk spectrum peaks in the soft X-rays and sustains Eddington luminosity for 1-3 yr after the disruption. For arbitrary BH spin orientations, the disrupted material is scattered away from the orbital plane by relativistic frame dragging, which often leads to obscuration of the inner fallback disk by the outflowing debris. The disruption events also yield bursts of gravitational radiation with characteristic frequencies of \~{}3.2 Hz and strain amplitudes of \~{}10-18 for galactic IMBHs. The optimistic rate of considered ultra-close disruptions is consistent with no sources found in the ROSAT all-sky survey. Future missions like Wide-Field X-ray Telescope could observe dozens of events.},

	N2 = {We examine the consequences of a model in which relativistic jets can be triggered in quiescent massive black holes when a geometrically thick and hot accretion disk forms as a result of the tidal disruption of a star. To estimate the power, thrust, and lifetime of the jet, we use the mass accretion history onto the black hole as calculated by detailed hydrodynamic simulations of the tidal disruption of stars. We go on to determine the states of the interstellar medium in various types of quiescent galactic nuclei, and describe how this external matter can affect jets propagating through it. We use this information, together with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the structure of the relativistic flow, to study the dynamics of the jet, the propagation of which is regulated by the density stratification of the environment and by its injection history. The breaking of symmetry involved in transitioning from one to two dimensions is crucial and leads to qualitatively new phenomena. At early times, as the jet power increases, the high pressure of the cocoon collimates the jet, increasing its shock velocity as compared to that of spherical models. We show that small velocity gradients, induced near or at the source, steepen into internal shocks and provide a source of free energy for particle acceleration and radiation along the jet's channel. The jets terminate at a working surface where they interact strongly with the surrounding medium through a combination of shock waves and instabilities; a continuous flow of relativistic fluid emanating from the nucleus supplies this region with mass, momentum, and energy. Information about the t -5/3 decrease in power supply propagates within the jet at the internal sound speed. As a result, the internal energy at the jet head continues to accumulate until long after the peak feeding rate is reached. An appreciable time delay is thus expected between peaks in the short-wavelength radiation emanating near the jet's origin and the long-wavelength emission produced at the head of the jet. Many of the observed properties of the Swift 1644+57/GRB 110328A event can be understood as resulting from accretion onto and jets driven by a 106 M \&sun; central mass black hole following the disruption of a sun-like star. With the inclusion of a stochastic contribution to the luminosity due to variations in the feeding rate driven by instabilities near the tidal radius, we find that our model can explain the X-ray light curve without invoking a rarely occurring deep encounter. In conjunction with the number density of black holes in the local universe, we hypothesize that the conditions required to produce the Swift event are not anomalous, but are in fact representative of the jet-driven flare population arising from tidal disruptions.},

	N2 = {The disruption of stars by supermassive black holes has been linked to more than a dozen flares in the cores of galaxies out to redshift z \~{} 0.4. Modeling these flares properly requires a prediction of the rate of mass return to the black hole after a disruption. Through hydrodynamical simulation, we show that aside from the full disruption of a solar mass star at the exact limit where the star is destroyed, the common assumptions used to estimate \dot{\{}M{\}}(t), the rate of mass return to the black hole, are largely invalid. While the analytical approximation to tidal disruption predicts that the least-centrally concentrated stars and the deepest encounters should have more quickly-peaked flares, we find that the most-centrally concentrated stars have the quickest-peaking flares, and the trend between the time of peak and the impact parameter for deeply penetrating encounters reverses beyond the critical distance at which the star is completely destroyed. We also show that the most-centrally concentrated stars produced a characteristic drop in \dot{\{}M{\}}(t) shortly after peak when a star is only partially disrupted, with the power law index n being as extreme as --4 in the months immediately following the peak of a flare. Additionally, we find that n asymptotes to \~{}= --2.2 for both low- and high-mass stars for approximately half of all stellar disruptions. Both of these results are significantly steeper than the typically assumed n = --5/3. As these precipitous decay rates are only seen for events in which a stellar core survives the disruption, they can be used to determine if an observed tidal disruption flare produced a surviving remnant. We provide fitting formulae for four fundamental quantities of tidal disruption as functions of the star's distance to the black hole at pericenter and its stellar structure: the total mass lost, the time of peak, the accretion rate at peak, and the power-law index shortly after peak. These results should be taken into consideration when flares arising from tidal disruptions are modeled.},

Here we present the results of a survey with more than 200 simulations systematically scanning the white dwarf binary parameter space. We consider white dwarf masses ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 M\&sun; and account for their different chemical compositions. We find excellent agreement with the orbital evolution predicted by mass transfer stability analysis. Much of our effort in this paper is dedicated to determining which binary systems are prone to a thermonuclear explosion just prior to merger or at surface contact. We find that a large fraction of He-accreting binary systems explode: all dynamically unstable systems with accretor masses below 1.1 M\&sun; and donor masses above ˜0.4 M\&sun; are found to trigger a helium detonation at surface contact. A substantial fraction of these systems could explode at earlier times via detonations induced by instabilities in the accretion stream, as we have demonstrated in our previous work. We do not find definitive evidence for an explosion prior to merger or at surface contact in any of the studied double carbon-oxygen systems. Although we cannot exclude their occurrence if some helium is present, the available parameter space for a successful detonation in a white dwarf binary of pure carbon-oxygen composition is small. We demonstrate that a wide variety of dynamically unstable systems are viable Type Ia candidates. The next decade thus holds enormous promise for the study of these events, in particular with the advent of wide-field synoptic surveys allowing a detailed characterization of their explosive properties.},

The six orders of magnitude mass ratio between the Galactic center black hole (BH) and the binary stars allows us to formulate the problem in the restricted parabolic three-body approximation. In this framework, results can be simply rescaled in terms of binary masses, their initial separation, and the binary-to-black hole mass ratio. Consequently, an advantage over the full three-body calculation is that a much smaller set of simulations is needed to explore the relevant parameter space. Contrary to previous claims, we show that, upon binary disruption, the lighter star does not remain preferentially bound to the black hole. In fact, it is ejected in exactly 50{\%} of the cases. Nonetheless, lighter objects have higher ejection velocities, since the energy distribution is independent of mass. Focusing on the planar case, we provide the probability distributions for disruption of circular binaries and for the ejection energy. We show that even binaries that penetrate deeply into the tidal sphere of the BH are not doomed to disruption, but survive in 20{\%} of the cases. Nor do these deep encounters produce the highest ejection energies, which are instead obtained for binaries arriving to 0.1-0.5 of the tidal radius in a prograde orbit. Interestingly, such deep-reaching binaries separate widely after penetrating the tidal radius, but always approach each other again on their way out from the BH. Finally, our analytic method allows us to account for a finite size of the stars and recast the ejection energy in terms of a minimal possible separation. We find that, for a given minimal separation, the ejection energy is relatively insensitive to the initial binary separation.},

The orbit of a binary with mass m around a massive object M should be almost parabolic with an eccentricity of {$|$}1 - e{$|$} <\~{} (m/M)1/3 Lt 1 for a member to be captured, while the other is ejected. Indeed, the energy change of the members obtained for a parabolic orbit can be used to describe non-parabolic cases. If a binary has an encounter velocity much larger than (M/m)1/3 times the binary rotation velocity, it would be abruptly disrupted, and the energy change at the encounter can be evaluated in a simple disruption model. We evaluate the probability distributions for the ejection and capture of circular binary members and for the final energies. In principle, for any hyperbolic (elliptic) orbit, the heavier member has more chance to be ejected (captured), because it carries a larger fraction of the orbital energy. However, if the orbital energy is close to zero, the difference between the two members becomes small, and there is practically no ejection and capture preferences. The preference becomes significant when the orbital energy is comparable to the typical energy change at the encounter. We discuss its implications to hypervelocity stars and irregular satellites around giant planets.},

	N2 = {We study the tidal excitation of gravity modes (g-modes) in compact white dwarf binary systems with periods ranging from minutes to hours. As the orbit of the system decays via gravitational radiation, the orbital frequency increases and sweeps through a series of resonances with the g-modes of the white dwarf. At each resonance, the tidal force excites the g-mode to a relatively large amplitude, transferring the orbital energy to the stellar oscillation. We calculate the eigenfrequencies of g-modes and their coupling coefficients with the tidal field for realistic non-rotating white dwarf models. Using these mode properties, we numerically compute the excited mode amplitude in the linear approximation as the orbit passes though the resonance, including the backreaction of the mode on the orbit. We also derive analytical estimates for the mode amplitude and the duration of the resonance, which accurately reproduce our numerical results for most binary parameters. We find that the g-modes can be excited to a dimensionless (mass-weighted) amplitude up to 0.1, with the mode energy approaching {\$}10\^{}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} of the gravitational binding energy of the star. This suggests that thousands of years prior to the binary merger, the white dwarf may be heated up significantly by tidal interactions. However, more study is needed since the physical amplitudes of the excited oscillation modes become highly nonlinear in the outer layer of the star, which can reduce the mode amplitude attained by tidal excitation.},

We show that above about 1.5 times the standard critical mass accretion rate (needed to release the Eddington luminosity), the net luminosity released is above Eddington. At above about 5 times the standard critical rate, the central BH accretes more than the Eddington accretion rate.

Numerical experiments with the code Athena show that the total energy is indeed conserved with our new algorithm and the new algorithm is second order accurate. We have performed a set of tests that show the numerical errors in the traditional, non-conservative algorithm can affect the dynamics of the system. The new algorithm only requires one extra solution of the Poisson equation, as compared to the traditional algorithm which includes self-gravity as a source term. If the Poisson solver takes a negligible fraction of the total simulation time, such as when FFTs are used, the new algorithm is almost as efficient as the original method. This new algorithm is useful in Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations with self-gravity, especially when results are sensitive to small energy errors, as for radiation pressure dominated flow.},

	N2 = {We demonstrate with a new three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement code that perturbations arising from discretization of the equations of self-gravitational hydrodynamics can grow into fragments in multiple-grid simulations, a process we term "artificial fragmentation." We present star formation calculations of isothermal collapse of dense molecular cloud cores. In simulation of a Gaussian-profile cloud free of applied perturbations, we find artificial fragmentation can be avoided across the isothermal density regime by ensuring the ratio of cell size to Jeans length, which we call the Jeans number, J= Delta x/ lambda {\_}{\{}{\{}J{\}}{\}} , is kept below 0.25. We refer to the constraint that lambda {\_}{\{}{\{}J{\}}{\}} be resolved as the Jeans condition. When an m=2 perturbation is included, we again find it necessary to keep J<=0.25 to achieve a converged morphology. Collapse to a filamentary singularity occurs without fragmentation of the filament, in agreement with the predictions of Inutsuka \& Miyama. Simulation beyond the time of this singularity requires an arresting agent to slow the runaway density growth. Physically, the breakdown of isothermality due to the buildup of opacity acts as this agent, but many published calculations have instead used artificial viscosity for this purpose. Because artificial viscosity is resolution dependent, such calculations produce resolution-dependent results. In the context of the perturbed Gaussian cloud, we show that use of artificial viscosity to arrest collapse results in significant violation of the Jeans condition. We also show that if the applied perturbation is removed from such a calculation, numerical fluctuations grow to produce substantial fragments not unlike those found when the perturbation is included. These findings indicate that calculations that employ artificial viscosity to halt collapse are susceptible to contamination by artificial fragmentation. The Jeans condition has important implications for numerical studies of isothermal self-gravitational hydrodynamics problems insofar as it is a necessary but not, in general, sufficient condition for convergence.},

	N2 = {We investigate the dynamics of clumps embedded in and confined by the advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), in which collisions among the clumps are neglected. We start from the collisionless Boltzmann equation and assume that interaction between the clumps and the ADAF is responsible for transporting the angular momentum of clumps outward. The inner edge of the clumpy-ADAF is set to be the tidal radius of the clumps. We consider strong- and weak-coupling cases, in which the averaged properties of clumps follow the ADAF dynamics and are mainly determined by the black hole potential, respectively. We propose the analytical solution of the dynamics of clumps for the two cases. The velocity dispersion of clumps is one magnitude higher than the ADAF for the strong-coupling case. For the weak-coupling case, we find that the mean radial velocity of clumps is linearly proportional to the coefficient of the drag force. We show that the tidally disrupted clumps would lead to an accumulation of the debris to form a debris disk in the Shakura-Sunyaev regime. The entire hot ADAF will be efficiently cooled down by photons from the debris disk, giving rise to a collapse of the ADAF, and quench the clumpy accretion. Subsequently, evaporation of the collapsed ADAF drives resuscitate of a new clumpy-ADAF, resulting in an oscillation of the global clumpy-ADAF. Applications of the present model are briefly discussed to X-ray binaries, low ionization nuclear emission regions, and BL Lac objects.},

Exploring cloud parameter space, I find that clouds with density n˜1012 cm-3 and column NH > 4 ×1024 cm-2 reflect most of the intrinsic continuum, but convert a substantial fraction of the EUV luminosity into lines, dominated by Lyβand He II Lyα. When velocity-blurred, this makes a false continuum peak at ˜1100 {\AA}which fits the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) well, but turns back up in the FUV to make a hard EUV SED, as required by ionization models. I argue that the observed UV variability is dominated by this component of fixed shape, possibly due to changes of covering factor. The amount of mass required is small, so it is not necessary to disrupt the disc, but only to make an unstable and inhomogeneous atmosphere. The proposed clouds may be related to those suggested by several X-ray phenomena (X-ray reflection components, high-velocity outflows, Compton thick partial covering) but are not the same, leading to a picture with a wide range of inhomogeneous structures at different radii.},

Nine of the objects in the sample (including NGC 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad Hβemission, which we have previously reported. We present here the light curves for the Hα, Hγ, He II λ4686, and He I λ5876 emission lines and the time lags for the emission-line responses relative to changes in the continuum flux. Combining each emission-line time lag with the measured width of the line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determine a virial mass of the central supermassive black hole from several independent emission lines. We find that the masses are generally consistent within the uncertainties. The time-lag response as a function of velocity across the Balmer line profiles is examined for six of the AGNs. We find similar responses across all three Balmer lines for Arp 151, which shows a strongly asymmetric profile, and for SBS 1116+583A and NGC 6814, which show a symmetric response about zero velocity. For the other three AGNs, the data quality is somewhat lower and the velocity-resolved time-lag response is less clear. Finally, we compare several trends seen in the data set against the predictions from photoionization calculations as presented by Korista \& Goad. We confirm several of their predictions, including an increase in responsivity and a decrease in the mean time lag as the excitation and ionization level for the species increases. Specifically, we find the time lags of the optical recombination lines to have weighted mean ratios of τ(Hα):τ(Hβ):τ(Hγ):τ(He I):τ(He II) = 1.54:1.00:0.61:0.36:0.25. Further confirmation of photoionization predictions for broad-line gas behavior will require additional monitoring programs for these AGNs while they are in different luminosity states.},

	N2 = {We investigate the effect of a global change in the ionizing continuum level on the behavior of the strong optical broad emission lines seen in spectra of the nuclear emission-line regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including the Balmer lines, He I λ5876, and He II λ4686. Unlike most of the prominent heavy-element lines found in the UV, the optical hydrogen and helium recombination lines' emissivities are strongly dependent on the incident continuum flux, since these lines arise out of excited states whose optical depths depend on the incident flux of photons. Using photoionization calculations, we determine the luminosity-dependent responsivities, η(r,L(t))=ΔlogLline/ΔlogLcont, of these lines for a general model of the broad emission line region (BLR), with the purpose of establishing them as important probes of the physical conditions within the BLRs of AGNs. The dependence of these lines' emissivities on the incident photon flux invokes a dependence in their responsivities on distance from the central continuum source. In particular, the responsivities of these lines are generally anticorrelated with the incident photon flux. Thus, their responsivities vary with distance within the BLR for a fixed continuum luminosity and change with time as the continuum source varies. Consequently, after correcting for light-travel-time effects, the response of the Balmer and optical helium lines should generally be strongest during low continuum luminosity states. Responsivity that depends on photon flux and continuum state may explain a number of outstanding problems currently under investigation in broad-line variability studies of these and other emission lines. These include the origin of the intrinsic Baldwin effect, measurements of luminosity-dependent lags (a ``breathing'' BLR), and luminosity-dependent variations in integrated broad emission line flux ratios (including He II λ4686/Hβ), broad-line profile shapes, and radial velocity-dependent intensity ratios. The broad Hα/Hβand He I/Hβflux ratios and the Balmer emission line responsivity are observed to decrease from the line center to the line wings. These, along with our findings, lead to the conclusion that the BLR velocity field diminishes with increasing distance from the central continuum source. This is consistent with recent reverberation studies that find a relationship between the emission-line lag and rms profile width for multiple lines in individual AGNs, which implies that the velocity field is dominated by a central massive object. Finally, the responsivity of ionization-bounded clouds can account for much of the observed behavior of the optical recombination lines (e.g., the weak response of the Balmer line wings) previously attributed to a substantial contribution from matter-bounded clouds at small BLR radii.},

Two tidal disruption events were simulated using a three-dimensional relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics code to describe the early evolution of the debris during the first 50-90 days. We have calculated the physical conditions and radiative processes in the debris using the photoionization code CLOUDY. We model the emission-line profiles in the period immediately after the accretion rate onto the black hole became significant. We find that the line profiles at these very early stages of the evolution of the postdisruption debris do not resemble the double-peaked profiles expected from a rotating disk, since the debris has not yet settled into such a stable structure. As a result of the uneven distribution of the debris and the existence of a ``tidal tail'' (the stream of returning debris), the line profiles depend sensitively on the orientation of the tail relative to the line of sight. Moreover, the predicted line profiles vary on fairly short timescales (of the order of hours to days). Given the accretion rate onto the black hole, we also model the Hαlight curve from the debris and the evolution of the Hαline profiles in time.},

The goal was to monitor anticipated variations of the broad, double-peaked Balmer lines which appeared abruptly in 1991. We find that the broad Balmer lines have varied significantly over the monitoring period, both in their integrated fluxes and in their profile shapes. The integrated H-alpha flux has decreased by a factor of 2, the (H-alpha)/(H-beta) ratio has increased, and the originally asymmetric H-alpha profile has become symmetric. The decline of the H-alpha flux and the change in the (H-alpha)/(H-beta) ratio can be interpreted as consequences of either increased obscuration along the line of sight, or a decline in the ionizing continuum, but neither of these scenarios can account for the change in profile shapes. A model attributing the line emission to a precessing elliptical ring around a 106 solar mass nuclear black hole can reproduce the observed profile variations. In this scenario, the line-emitting ring is the result of the tidal disruption of a star by the black hole. Alternative scenarios associating the broad-line emission with a collimated bipolar outflow also remain viable, but binary black holes and inhomogeneous accretion disks are disfavored by the observed pattern of variability.},

Our calculations are motivated by the fact that in about one-quarter of the double-peaked emission lines observed in radio-loud active galactic nuclei (and in the mildly active nucleus of NGC 1097), the red peak is stronger than the blue peak, which is contrary to the prediction of relativistic, circular disk models. Using the eccentric disk model we fit some of the observed profiles that cannot be fitted with a circular disk model. We propose two possible scenarios for the formation of an eccentric disk in an active galactic nucleus: (a) tidal perturbation of the disk around a supermassive black hole by a smaller binary companion, and (b) formation of an elliptical disk from the debris resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by the central black hole. In the former case we show that the eccentricity can be long-lived because of the presence of the binary companion. In the latter case, although the inner parts of the disk may circularize quickly, we estimate that the outer parts will maintain their eccentricity for times much longer than the local viscous time. We suggest that it may be possible to detect profile variability on much shorter timescales than those ranging from a decade to several centuries by comparing the evolution of the line profile with detailed model predictions. We argue that line-profile variability may also be the most promising discriminant among competing models for the origin of asymmetric, double-peaked emission lines.},

It is argued that there are astrophysical implications of such a result for initially eccentric streams of gas, either in a Kepler potential, or where the accretion rate is high compared to the rate of differential precession of streamlines.},

Subsequently the fraction of hot gas slowly increases at the expense of the cold component while the ionization parameter of both components remains equal to Xi(c). Photoionization of cold gas in the outmoving and radially elongated remnant clouds produces a broad line region at a distance of about 10 exp 16-17 cm in Seyferts and about 10 exp 17-18 cm in quasars. A tidal disruption model is presented which offers a natural interpretation for both the broad emission lines and a number of other features in AGN spectra.},

	N2 = {Sagittarius A*, which is located at the Galactic center, is a puzzling source. It has a mass of (2.5$\pm$0.4)×106 Msun, which makes it an excellent black hole candidate. Observations of stellar winds and other gas flows in its vicinity suggest a mass accretion rate (M˙) of a few times 10-6 Msunyr-1. However, such an accretion rate would imply a luminosity greater than 1040 erg s-1 if the radiative efficiency is the usual 10{\%}, whereas observations indicate a bolometric luminosity less than 1037 erg s-1. The spectrum of Sgr A* is unusual, with emission extending over many decades of wavelength. The authors present a model of Sgr A* that is based on a two temperature optically thin advection-dominated accretion flow. The model is consistent with the estimated M and M˙and fits the observed fluxes in the cm/mm and X-ray bands, as well as upper limits in the submm and infrared bands; the fit is less good in the radio spectrum below 86 GHz and in γ-rays above 100 MeV. The very low luminosity of Sgr A* is explained naturally in the model by means of advection. Most of the viscously dissipated energy is advected into the central mass by the accreting gas, and therefore the radiative efficiency is extremely low, ≡5×10-6. A critical element of the model is the presence of an event horizon at the center that swallows the advected energy.},

	N2 = {Sun-like stars are thought to be regularly disrupted by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within galactic nuclei. Yet, as stars evolve off the main sequence their vulnerability to tidal disruption increases drastically as they develop a bifurcated structure consisting of a dense core and a tenuous envelope. Here we present the first hydrodynamic simulations of the tidal disruption of giant stars and show that the core has a substantial influence on the star's ability to survive the encounter. Stars with more massive cores retain large fractions of their envelope mass, even in deep encounters. Accretion flares resulting from the disruption of giant stars should last for tens to hundreds of years. Their characteristic signature in transient searches would not be the t -5/3 decay typically associated with tidal disruption events, but a correlated rise over many orders of magnitude in brightness on timescales of months to years. We calculate the relative disruption rates of stars of varying evolutionary stages in typical galactic centers, then use our results to produce Monte Carlo realizations of the expected flaring event populations. We find that the demographics of tidal disruption flares are strongly dependent on both stellar and black hole mass, especially near the limiting SMBH mass scale of \~{}108 M \&sun;. At this black hole mass, we predict a sharp transition in the SMBH flaring diet beyond which all observable disruptions arise from evolved stars, accompanied by a dramatic cutoff in the overall tidal disruption flaring rate. Black holes less massive than this limiting mass scale will show observable flares from both main-sequence and evolved stars, with giants contributing up to 10{\%} of the event rate. The relative fractions of stars disrupted at different evolutionary states can constrain the properties and distributions of stars in galactic nuclei other than our own.},

	N2 = {The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) is a highly energetic event with consequences dependent on the degree to which the star plunges inside the SMBH's tidal sphere. We introduce a new analytic model for tidal disruption events (TDEs) to analyse the dependence of these events on β, the ratio of the tidal radius to the orbital pericentre. We find, contrary to most previous work, that the spread in debris energy for a TDE is largely constant for all β. This result has important consequences for optical transient searches targeting TDEs, which we discuss. We quantify leading-order general relativistic corrections to this spread in energy and find that they are small. We also examine the role of stellar spin and find that a combination of spin-orbit misalignment, rapid rotation and high βmay alter the spread in debris energy. Finally, we quantify for the first time the gravitational wave emission due to the strong compression of a star in a high-βTDE. Although this signal is unlikely to be detectable for disruptions of main-sequence stars, the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole can produce a strong signal visible to Advanced LIGO at tens of megaparsecs.},

	N2 = {We study accretion processes for tidally disrupted stars approaching supermassive black holes on bound orbits, by performing three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find that there is a critical value of the orbital eccentricity below which all the stellar debris remains bound to the black hole. For high but subcritical eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted on to the black hole in a finite time, causing a significant deviation from the canonical t-5/3 mass fallback rate. When a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit and its pericentre distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption radius, there can be several orbit crossings of the debris streams due to relativistic precession. This dissipates orbital energy in shocks, allowing for rapid circularization of the debris streams and formation of an accretion disc. The resultant accretion rate greatly exceeds the Eddington rate and differs strongly from the canonical rate of t-5/3. By contrast, there is little dissipation due to orbital crossings for the equivalent simulation with a purely Newtonian potential. This shows that general relativistic precession is crucial for accretion disc formation via circularization of stellar debris from stars on moderately eccentric orbits.},

	N2 = {A large population of planetary candidates in short-period orbits have been found recently through transit searches, mostly with the Kepler mission. Radial velocity surveys have also revealed several Jupiter-mass planets with highly eccentric orbits. Measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect indicate that the orbital angular momentum vector of some planets is inclined relative to the spin axis of their host stars. This diversity could be induced by post-formation dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering, the Kozai effect, or secular chaos which brings planets to the vicinity of their host stars. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism to form close-in super-Earths and Neptune-like planets through the tidal disruption of gas giant planets as a consequence of these dynamical processes. We model the core-envelope structure of gas giant planets with composite polytropes which characterize the distinct chemical composition of the core and envelope. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of close encounters between Jupiter-like planets and their host stars, we find that the presence of a core with a mass more than 10 times that of the Earth can significantly increase the fraction of envelope which remains bound to it. After the encounter, planets with cores are more likely to be retained by their host stars in contrast with previous studies which suggested that coreless planets are often ejected. As a substantial fraction of their gaseous envelopes is preferentially lost while the dense incompressible cores retain most of their original mass, the resulting metallicity of the surviving planets is increased. Our results suggest that some gas giant planets can be effectively transformed into either super-Earths or Neptune-like planets after multiple close stellar passages. Finally, we analyze the orbits and structure of known planets and Kepler candidates and find that our model is capable of producing some of the shortest-period objects.},

Previous works neglected the effect of lunar tides on planet rotation, and are therefore applicable only to systems in which the moon's mass is much less than that of the planet. This work, in contrast, can be applied to the relatively large moons that might be detected around newly discovered Neptune-mass and super-Earth planets. We conclude that moons are more stable when the planet/moon systems are further from the parent star, the planets are heavier, or the parent stars are lighter. Inclusion of lunar tides allows for significantly longer lifetimes for a massive moon relative to prior formulations. We expect that the semimajor axis of the planet hosting the first detected exomoon around a G-type star is 0.4-0.6 AU and is 0.2-0.4 AU for an M-type star.},

The effects of stellar variability, instrument noise and photon noise are all accounted for in the analysis. We validate our methodology by simulating synthetic light curves and performing a Monte Carlo analysis for several cases of interest. We find that habitable-zone exomoons down to 0.2M⊕may be detected and \~{}25000 stars could be surveyed for habitable-zone exomoons within Kepler's field of view. A Galactic plane survey with Kepler-class photometry could potentially survey over one million stars for habitable-zone exomoons.

	N2 = {New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone. All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase. The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Z masses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density (sigma{\_}init) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that sigma{\_}init \~{} 10 g cm\^{}-2 near Jupiter's orbit and that sigma{\_}init \~{} a\^{}-2, where a is the distance from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the ``minimum-mass'' solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems.},

	N2 = {New transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (May 2009 - September 2010) of data from the Kepler spacecraft. Nearly five thousand periodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental false positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total count up to over 2,300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging of multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis which identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the new candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T{\_}0, and orbital period, P) are tabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius (Rp/R*), reduced semi-major axis (d/R*), and impact parameter (b). The largest fractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197{\%} for candidates smaller than 2Re compared to 52{\%} for candidates larger than 2Re) and those at longer orbital periods (123{\%} for candidates outside of 50-day orbits versus 85{\%} for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). The gains are larger than expected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (Quarter 1-- Quarter 5) to sixteen months (Quarter 1 -- Quarter 6). This demonstrates the benefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. The fraction of all host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17{\%} to 20{\%}, and the paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The progression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new catalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone are forthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.},

Here we consider the possibility that some very close-in gas giants or a population of rocky planets may have either undergone orbital decay or been engulfed by the expanding envelope of their intermediate-mass host stars. If such events occur during or shortly after those stars' main-sequence evolution when their convection zone remains relatively shallow, their surface metallicity would be significantly enhanced by the consumption of one or more gas giants. During the evolution of a star with a given mass and internal metallicity, a surface temperature-luminosity relation maps its evolutionary track. Therefore, we can infer the internal metallicity with the observables including the star's brightness, color, parallax, and the planet's transit light curve. Whether a star is polluted is then determined by the comparison between the inferred internal metallicity and the observed surface metallicity. As an example, we consider HD 149026, possibly a post-main-sequence star, and suggest its observed high (nearly twice solar) metallicity may be confined to its surface layer as a consequence of pollution by the accretion of a gas giant or a population of smaller-mass rocky planets. We show that the extent of pollution can be inferred directly from high-precision distance determinations, radial velocity, and transit light curves.},

	N2 = {We show that ongoing direct imaging experiments may detect a new class of long-period, highly luminous, tidally powered extrasolar gas giants. Even though they are hosted by Gyr-"old" main-sequence stars, they can be as "hot" as young Jupiters at \~{}100 Myr, the prime targets of direct imaging surveys. These planets, with years-long orbits, are presently migrating to "feed" the "hot Jupiters" in steady state. Their existence is expected from a class of "high-e" migration mechanisms, in which gas giants are excited to highly eccentric orbits and then shrink their semi-major axis by factor of \~{} 10-100 due to tidal dissipation at successive close periastron passages. The dissipated orbital energy is converted to heat, and if it is deposited deep enough into the planet atmosphere, the planet likely radiates steadily at luminosity \~{}2-3 orders of magnitude larger than that of our Jupiter during a typical Gyr migration time scale. Their large orbital separations and expected high planet-to-star flux ratios in IR make them potentially accessible to high-contrast imaging instruments on 10m-class telescopes at present and in the near future. A dozen or so such planets are expected to exist around FGK dwarfs within \~{}50 pc. Long-period planets around nearby stars found by RV are viable candidates to follow up, and in particular, the highly eccentric planet HD 20782b at maximum angular separation \~{} 0.08" is the most promising candidate. Directly imaging these tidally powered Jupiters would enable a direct test of high-e migration mechanisms. Once detected, the luminosity would provide a direct measurement of the migration rate, and together with mass (and possibly radius) estimate, they would serve as a laboratory to study planetary spectral formation and tidal physics.},

We use numerical models to simulate the full spectrum of observable velocities of stars ejected into the halo by this binary disruption process. Our models include a range of parameters for binaries with 3-4 Msolar primaries, consideration of radial orbits of the ejected stars through an approximate mass distribution for the Galaxy, and the impact of stellar lifetimes. We calculate the spectrum of ejection velocities and reproduce previous results for the mean ejection velocity at the Galactic center. The model predicts that the full population of ejected stars includes both the hypervelocity stars with velocities large enough to escape from the Galaxy and a comparable number of ejected, but bound, stars of the same stellar type. The predicted median speeds of the population of ejected stars as a function of distance in the halo are consistent with current observations. Combining the model with the data also shows that interesting constraints on the properties of binaries in the Galactic center and on the mass distribution in the Galaxy can be obtained even with modest samples of ejected stars.},

The significant asymmetry we observe in the velocity distribution-we find 26 stars with vrf>275 km s-1 and one star with vrf<-275 km s-1-shows that HVSs must be short-lived, probably 3-4 Msolar main-sequence stars. Any population of hypervelocity post-main-sequence stars should contain stars falling back onto the Galaxy, contrary to the observations. The spatial distribution of HVSs also supports the main-sequence interpretation: longer lived 3 Msolar HVSs fill our survey volume; shorter lived 4 Msolar HVSs are missing at faint magnitudes. We infer that there are 96+/-10 HVSs of mass 3-4 Msolar within R<100 kpc, possibly enough HVSs to constrain ejection mechanisms and potential models. Depending on the mass function of HVSs, we predict that SEGUE may find up to 5-15 new HVSs. The travel times of our HVSs favor a continuous ejection process, although a \~{}120 Myr old burst of HVSs is also allowed.},

In the Milky Way, HVSs and the S star cluster imply similar rates of 10-5 to 10-3 yr-1 for binary disruption. These rates are consistent with estimates for the tidal disruption rate in nearby galaxies and imply significant black hole growth from disrupted binaries on 10 Gyr timescales.},

We show that the Galactic potential within 200 pc acts as a high-pass filter preventing low-velocity HVSs from reaching the halo. To trace the orbits of HVSs throughout the Galaxy, we construct two forms of the potential which reasonably represent the observations in the range 5-105 pc: a simple spherically symmetric model and a bulge-disk-halo model. We use the Hills mechanism (disruption of binaries by the tidal field of the central black hole) to inject HVSs into the Galaxy and to compute the observable spatial and velocity distributions of HVSs with masses in the range 0.6-4 Msolar. These distributions reflect the mass function in the Galactic center, properties of binaries in the Galactic center, and aspects of stellar evolution and the injection mechanism. For 0.6-4 Msolar main-sequence stars, the fraction of unbound HVSs and the asymmetry of the velocity distribution for their bound counterparts increase with stellar mass. The density profiles for unbound HVSs decline with distance from the Galactic center approximately as r-2 (but are steeper for the most massive stars, which evolve off the main sequence during their travel time from the Galactic center); the density profiles for the bound ejecta decline with distance approximately as r-3. In a survey with a limiting magnitude of V<\~{}23, the detectability of HVSs (unbound or bound) increases with stellar mass.},

	N2 = {We obtain Keck HIRES spectroscopy of HVS5, one of the fastest unbound stars in the Milky Way halo. We show that HVS5 is a 3.62 $\pm$0.11 M \&sun; main-sequence B star at a distance of 50 $\pm$5 kpc. The difference between its age and its flight time from the Galactic center is 105 $\pm$18 (stat) $\pm$30 (sys) Myr; flight times from locations elsewhere in the Galactic disk are similar. This 108 yr "arrival time" between formation and ejection is difficult to reconcile with any ejection scenario involving massive stars that live for only 107 yr. For comparison, we derive arrival times of 107 yr for two unbound runaway B stars, consistent with their disk origin where ejection results from a supernova in a binary system or dynamical interactions between massive stars in a dense star cluster. For HVS5, ejection during the first 107 yr of its lifetime is ruled out at the 3σlevel. Together with the 108 yr arrival times inferred for three other well-studied hypervelocity stars (HVSs), these results are consistent with a Galactic center origin for the HVSs. If the HVSs were indeed ejected by the central black hole, then the Galactic center was forming stars sime200 Myr ago, and the progenitors of the HVSs took sime100 Myr to enter the black hole's loss cone.},

	N2 = {Runaway stars ejected from the Galactic disk populate the halo of the Milky Way. To predict the spatial and kinematic properties of runaways, we inject stars into a Galactic potential, compute their trajectories through the Galaxy, and derive simulated catalogs for comparison with observations. Runaways have a flattened spatial distribution, with higher velocity stars at Galactic latitudes less than 30$\,^{\circ}$. Due to their shorter stellar lifetimes, massive runaway stars are more concentrated toward the disk than low mass runaways. Bound (unbound) runaways that reach the halo probably originate from distances of 6-12 kpc (10-15 kpc) from the Galactic center, close to the estimated origin of the unbound runaway star HD 271791. Because runaways are brighter and have smaller velocities than hypervelocity stars (HVSs), radial velocity surveys are unlikely to confuse runaway stars with HVSs. We estimate that at most one runaway star contaminates the current sample. We place an upper limit of 2{\%} on the fraction of A-type main-sequence stars ejected as runaways.},

Practically all the components in the separation range 0farcs3 -6farcs4 (45-900 AU) and magnitudes down to K = 16 were detected. The K and J - K photometry of the primaries and differential photometry and astrometry of the 96 secondaries are presented. Ten secondaries are new physical components, as inferred from the photometric and statistical criteria, while the rest of the newly detected objects are faint background stars. After a small correction for detection incompleteness and a conversion of the fluxes into masses, an unbiased distribution of the components mass ratio q was derived. The power law f(q)\~{} q-0.5 fits the observations well, whereas a q-1.8 distribution, which corresponds to a random pairing of stars, is rejected. The companion star fraction is 0.20+/-0.04 per decade of separation which is comparable to the highest measured binary fraction among low-mass PMS stars and \~{} 1.6 times higher than the binary fraction of low-mass dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and in open clusters in the same separation range.
